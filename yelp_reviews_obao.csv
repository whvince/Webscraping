"My usual spot for pho and pad kee mao. I think both are really well done and basically recommend almost everything on their menu. They have fantastic happy hour prices... like kimchi fries for $6 or fresh calamari for $6.

Ambiance: 4/5
Food: solid 5/5
Service: 5/5 water was never empty.

I highly recommend this spot. Never disappoints for a good hangover spot.",Alex L.,"New York, NY",1/19/2020,5.0
"Found this place on Yelp, and what better food to eat on a snowy New York night than pho?

Obao is conveniently located right by the Lex-53 station. The salt & pepper shrimp was super hot but crispy enough to eat it shell and all. The pho bo noodles were chewy, I forgot to ask for the meat on the outside. Next time!

Can't wait to come again and I might not wait for a snow day!",Laura K.,"New York, NY",1/18/2020,5.0
"Came here on a Friday night, made reservations for two at 6:15pm. I love the new feature where I can make a reservation directly through Yelp now, before I would have to go through the hassle of looking them up on their website and then booking through there, but I find this to be way more user friendly. We arrived on time, and were seated immediately. It wasn't as crowded, which was nice.

I normally order their grilled pork and shrimp Bun, but I was craving for some Bo Luc Lac, and boy did I regret my decision. For $19, it was an utter disappointment. First, I knew something was off when our meal arrived about five minutes after we ordered it, which leads me to believe everything was already prepared and just sitting there waiting to be heated up. Second, the Bo Luc Lac was not traditional. It was not cooked properly. I am used to it usually being cooked to about a medium rare, and they were not even the proper size. The taste was also extremely off. It made me regret being adventurous with their menu, and decided to stick to what I know next time.

We also ordered their calamari appetizer, which I enjoyed, and my boyfriend ordered their Pho, which he enjoyed. Service was good and attentive.",Katy L.,"New York, NY",1/18/2020,2.0

Love the food and drinks here.  Especially ONE THOUSAND ONE NIGHT

They are very friendly",JJ C.,"Manhattan, NY",1/17/2020,5.0
"I worked around the corner from this place for years before I actually checked it out. My girls and I met up for a little happy hour moment and picked Obao because we had all been wanting to try it.

The service at Obao was great. Everyone on staff was very nice and accommodating. The food however, was underwhelming. I loved the little steamed dumplings but the rest were very underwhelming. Great drink deals though and they weren't very busy, so I would probably only come back for HH.",Mia N.,"New York, NY",12/11/2019,3.0
"The khao soi here: WOW. If you like curry noodle soup DEFINITELY stop by and order this dish! I felt transported back to Chiang mai, Thailand (not quite the same price point but! Really satisfying, coconut-y curry was on point, topped with crispy noodles, plenty of egg noodles in soup. AH)

My friend had the pad kee mao and was also very impressed.

(I ordered the OBAO cocktail and was not a huge fan of the jalape√±o)",Regina L.,"New York, NY",1/2/2020,5.0
"Love the ambiance of this location and the food is super tasty! I think this would be a really cute place for a date night. I ordered the clay pot catfish and it was really flavorful. They give a good amount of fish fillets and veggies and I was able to separate it into two meals. It's one of my favorite meals to eat growing up, and this is nonetheless extremely comforting.

My friend had their khao soi which is a curry dish with crispy noodles and that was so, so good! I loved that the noodles softens up and soaks up all the curry goodness. There's so much flavor in this dish, I can't wait to come back and order this for myself next time!

The prices are decent for NY and I'd recommend trying this restaurant!",Stephanie C.,"New York, NY",10/17/2019,4.0
Doesn't look like much when you stroll by but the food is surprisingly good!! We came here during lunch time and were seated right away. We got the basil fried rice with chicken and the Pad Kee Mao. I would rank the noodles as better than the rice (which is also what they are known for)!! Will definitely be a regular customer.,Gauri L.,"Manhattan, NY",1/20/2020,5.0

Have a very nice experience with my friend here.",Bobi P.,"New York, NY",12/26/2019,5.0
"I came here for lunch and got the standard beef Pho with the meatball add on and the veggie spring rolls.  The broth was delicious, the thin beef slices were rubbery, the meatballs were good.  The veggie rolls were okay, the sauce was nothing special and did not make me want to dip my rolls in it. The environment is cute and airy though and it is a huge space.  The service was good as well and food came at a good pace.  Overall I wouldn't likely return unless I was right next to it.",Natalya S.,"New York, NY",12/6/2019,3.0

"Cute space, solid options, and reasonable prices at OBAO. Had the pho and kimchi fries and both were larger than expected in portioN size. Flavor on the pho was clean but left something to be desired for-- not going to be the deepest broth but hits the spot nonetheless. Appreciated that the kimchI toppings were dispersed throughout the mountain of fries for even flavor. Vietnamese iced coffee was 10/10, not too sweet and strong coffee flavor. Overall would come back.",Jessica H.,"Harrington Park, NJ",1/18/2020,4.0
"I came here late for a small appetizer and a glass of wine. Surprisingly, the pork belly is so crispy and juicy. Definitely highly recommend it :)",Helen W.,United Kingdom,1/20/2020,5.0
"I often come to have lunch here because I work around and I don't have much time for lunch. The food came very fast. I don't have to waste time waiting.

I ordered Pad thai everytime I came. Pad thai had the best combination of sour and sweet taste. They always serve Pad thai with a slice of lime and ground peanut. It's good to squeeze lime because Lime definitely made it less greasy. About peanut! It makes my Pad thai become too dry, I don't like it. That why I always ordered Pad thai without peanut!

And the special thing is they served Pad thai with poached eggs. I was surprised first time I came to eat but server recommended me to mix everything before eating. dammmmm it!!! It's creamy, juicy This dish became my favorite forever!.",Thitiwat P.,"New York, NY",1/13/2020,5.0
This place is good! I'm not going to say it was the best - the vegetarian pad Thai tasted like there was a lot of ketchup in there. We also got the veggie dumplings which I actually enjoyed and they were very filling. The eggplant dish was also good but expected the sauce to not be so watery. Drinks were good! Nice happy hour. The dessert we got was great (chocolate mouse). It's a little cramped in there but aesthetic is nice. Service was good as well.,Mansi A.,"Boston, MA",1/21/2020,3.0
"I enjoyed this place more than the reviews led me to believe which is always pleasant.

Loves:
+ Really enjoyed the laksa ($15)
+ Got to love plant decor
+ Lots of seating
+ Tables are not cramped together
+ Reservations taken

TBH the Asian in me always screams inside when I see that four lil eggrolls are $10 (so obviously I didn't get that as our app), but the laksa really hit the spot for dinner that day. So yes to answer your question, I'd gladly come back! :)",Connie H.,"Brooklyn, NY",11/1/2019,4.0
"The ambiance and decor of OBAO is absolutely lovely. The staff is patient and very accommodating. They also have pretty solid happy hour deals.

I ordered a bun bo hue and it was pretty average. I found the broth to lack a bit of a lemongrass kick that I was anticipating. There was enough heat in the dish, just not enough lemongrass in my opinion. They're very generous with the meat in the dish though ^__^ The banh Mis looked really good.",Viona C.,"New York, NY",11/17/2019,3.0

"On New  Years   this place was one of the few places that was packed. We were just riding the E train with no particular place to go.

"Nice ambiance in the back room and the food was tasty. They have a few vegetarian and vegan options, but it's not extensive.

"Let me start by saying I am actually really disappointed by their food. Ordered three dishes and two of them are very salty and one is very sweet. So food-wise, it's like a 3 star.

The fours star mainly points to the service because they let us seat and enjoy the time with friends for like three hours without getting annoyed.

The happy hour drinks are reasonable too but the sake kind of feels watery.

No idea if i will come back to dine in here again.",Majer M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5/23/2019,4.0
"I love Obao!! I have been coming to this restaurant every few months for the last 2 years and it is one of my favorite places. Great noodles and broth and some solid vegetarian options. Also, it has great prices for the quality of food.",Allyson C.,"East Meadow, NY",1/17/2020,5.0
"I've been to OBAO a few times because the location is so convenient and they have so much space it's good for groups. During the summer they also have outdoor seating which you could also rent out.

Their happy hours are a great deal especially for the area. It's hard to find places with happy hours thats outside of the bar area. I've tried a few of their dishes usually just the noodles and they were really good and the portion sizes are perfect. I wouldn't say it's easy to share as a family style dish but if it's just you and another person it's easy to share. Their cocktails are also nice a lot of them are sweet and I wish they had more alcohol forward drinks but you can probably find a drink you like and for happy hour prices it's a steal. Also, every time I've been here the service was always quick and attentive.

I hear a lot of good things about their soup dishes so I might order that next time.

I've ordered takeout from them as well and they're very quick.",Ashley N.,"Manhattan, NY",10/6/2019,4.0
Great happy hour and the service was so good. The bo luc lac was so good. I get my lunch here all the time!! Love the food!!,Brittany Q.,"Washington, DC",1/21/2020,5.0
"not quite as much seating as the other location but still very cute on the inside.
i came back because bc i wanted those delicious kimchi fries at the other location...unfortunately they said no....literally 30 min after we were halfway done with our meal they go ""oh we have kimchi fries now"" and my heart sank. I was definitely too full to order them....next time!
Khao soi and drunken noodles here were good; asked for medium spicy and they ACTUALLY made it spicy!
Fried shrimp appetizer was okay; would probably get something else next time (ie the fries)
service was very frequent and kind. Hostess was very kind over the phone as well.
They take reservations and good for small groups! Would highly recommend this place for a casual night for dinner or a date night.",Jessica W.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",9/17/2019,4.0
"3.5 stars, rounded down.

Less frequented than the obao on the west side, this obao has gotten me out of a sticky situation many a time when I am struggling to come up with somewhere to go eat that is tasteful, but simultaneously affordable. In this area of town, rental prices for commercial units surely run very high, so it's nice when you find something that is not going to be prohibitive for anyone in your party.

For some reason, I always get seated at the front of the restaurant, though it seems like there is additional seating in the back. Food here is decent, and if you come for lunch, it's a much better deal than if you come here some other time of day. However, you don't get a whole lot of food, so there is that drawback. Like most asian eaterys, the waiters and waitresses can be a little pushy here. I once forgot to tip here, so I was reminded that I needed to tip. I suppose it was my fault, so I don't really fault the waiter for reminding me- however, technically, tipping is not mandatory, so it was a little bit annoying that I was reminded. However, after dropping $5 or so on the table, I was further informed that this wasn't a sufficient tip. I felt like this is kind of pushing it, since, again, tipping is not mandatory in NYS.

In conclusion, the food here is decent, though the portion size leaves a little to be desired, and the service is... assertive. May or may not be back, since I no longer live nearby.",Matt L.,"New York, NY",3/19/2019,3.0
"If not the best , then one of the best thai restaurant in New york. The perfect meals we've had in midtown . We love Obao . From the moment you walk into the moment you leave here is immense satisfaction with the ambiance , service, and amazing thai food .

"Still very solid and with friendly staff and plenty of seating in the front and back.  

The food is great and a nice mix of Thai and Vietnamese. Definitely get the Bo Lu Lac and Laksa - the beef is tender and the curry laksa broth very flavorful and creamy. The pad see ew is also very solid and a bit sweeter than other variants - but I like the sweeter flavor so your own mileage may vary. Portions are generous and prices very reasonable for the area - almost everything save for the Kalbi and lobster pad Thai are under $20.",Danan R.,"New York, NY",8/24/2019,4.0

"Came here for our 2nd wedding anniversary. We came here on our first date four years ago.

This place was great then, even better now. The decor feels more homey, with lighter walls. Low lighting and friendly service gives it a warm feel.

As for the food: highly recommend the dumplings appetizer -- there's some sort of herb/spice inside the dumpling that gives a great taste. Pad Thai was excellent, as was the Khao Soi (a curry soup with chicken and noodles) -- perfect for a cold winter night.

Our server checked in multiple times to make sure everything was good.

Highly recommend for a casual dinner or a low-key special event.",Arthur A.,"Rego Park, NY",11/12/2019,5.0
"My dad and me came here for dinner for the first time at this branch. We ordered Fresh Shrimp roll and Steamed Dumpling for appetizer. Moreover, Pad Kee Mao and Pad Thai for main dishes. All the foods came super fast. My dad was so surprised lol. It took about 2-3 minutes for Appetizer and not more than 5 minutes for Entrees.
Plus, the taste of foods was wonderful. Will come back again.",Ronnakrit K.,"Queens, Queens, NY",11/3/2019,5.0
"This spot is so perfect for your Thai fix, I've been to two locations and I've been equally impressed both times, attentive service and delicious food with fresh ingredients.

My mouth is drooling thinking about their food. Only downfall is it gets a really busy at times and makes the space loud and a long wait for a table, I suggest going at a quieter time if that sort of thing matters to you...let me know when you go because I will want to join!",Hannah M.,"New York, NY",7/25/2019,5.0
"My first time here and I had a pleasure to be served by Mr. Bank.
I had ribs on sugarcane which was delicious. First I thought it was some large bamboo sticks but you could actually chew the skewers for the juice. They are made from real sugarcane. The ribs were tender and juicy with some kind of savory sauce.

Mr. Bank had recommended Lobster Pad Thai to me as a main dish. Oh boy, you are not gonna believe it! The whole dish was covered with a gigantic lobster. I had to separate the bad boy to the side plate. He told me that I should poke the soft boiled egg and mix them well with the Pad Thai noodle, which I did. Oh lord, the noodles became creamier which in the way that I had never experienced Pad Thai before.

Too bad I was so full and could not try the dessert, but they all looked good though.

Bonus: Try the tamarind tequila cocktail. It was so good with a spicy kick on the mouth!",Teejay W.,"Woodside, NY",12/13/2019,5.0
"Dropped in for lunch at and got the pad sew ew. Service was quick and they were able to accommodate adding spice to my order but despite the spice, the dish was overall sweeter than most pad see ews I've had. There was a good amount of beef, eggs, and veggies and the beef was very tender (it was listed as coming from New Zealand). The portion was just enough to make me feel full but not stuffed. Overall, it's a decent spot.",Christine X.,"Seattle, WA",12/6/2019,3.0
"Never again..terrible customer service and the vegetable pad thai was drenched in sauce. I can even make better pad thai than that.

Came here during lunch time to order a pad thai to go. The host handed us the menu and walked away. When we returned to order our dishes, a different hostess took our order and handed me the ipad to sign with 18% gratuity selected. I found it odd as I was ordering it to go, but changed the tip amount quickly before signing it. I noticed she did the same thing when my friend was paying for her meal. Sensing that we were not giving her 18% tip, the hostess proceeded by telling us that she made an exception for us by allowing take-out as they don't do so before 2:30pm. I told her well in the case since it was my first time here, I won't be returning to order any more lunch. Her response was, that's fine with us!

"Stoped by OBAO for a really quick lunch, and I say quick because the food came out in about 5 minutes after ordering, I kid you not. Mind you, we sat down around 12:15 ish? So I think it was right before the rush.

I ordered the pad kee Mao and asked for it spicy. Whenever I don't emphasize how spicy I want it, servers don't believe me so expectantly it wasn't spicy even a little bit. That annoys me. The food was hot and looks appetizing but taste was a bit bland to be honest, like it was missing something.

I may come back to try the pho because that smelled really good,  but wouldn't recommend the pad kee Mao. While service was really fast, 2 stars goes to the meal itself.",Ashley D.,"Fords, NJ",5/8/2019,2.0

"Okay I have to say I have looked near and far, Harlem to cobble hill and this is THE best pad Thai I have found in NYC.

With a sweet base, this pad Thai offers the perfect amount of texture with the picturesque addition of a poached egg in the middle, and jumbo large shrimp amidst a fully topped crunchy peanut bed of delicious noodles. Great texture and sauce, with a medium spice per my request.

Good drink menu but also lunch specials if you're looking to stop by with coworkers. We were sat and seated as a group of 4 immediately in this surprisingly large restaurant. This place has quick service and gets you in and out while feeling like you're special.

The food is great- mini mini portions though!! Order one extra thing or some sides to actually feel satisfyingly full. More on the salty side but its thai food- just order more rice!
The waitresses and waiters are nice but it is severely understaffed. I waited 1 hour for a table because the host was busy bussing tables, taking orders and mixing drinks.

"I came here for NYC restaurant week but no restaurant week?! So disappointed. Because of good reviews and they supposed to be participating in restaurant week, I tried this place. And it was meh.

Location: the interior is okay, we got seated immediately. Intimate ambience and the bar is cool cause you could see them cooking.

Service: the girl who serves us has an attitude. She was pissed off when I ask why theres no restaurant week, her voice changed with a high tone!

Food: PAD THAI: this is the best dish here, it has poached egg that makes the sauce creamy and tasty, good amount of shrimps too. SAMBAL SPICED CALAMARI: this is another good dish, crispy with saut√©ed onions. STEAMED DUMPLINGS: dont order, its a regular dumplings, nothing special. PAD SEE IEW: it was okay, but to small serving. SPICY LEMONGRASS KALBI SHORT RIBS: dont order!! Pricey and not good! 21 dollars for this and the meat is very hard, the seasoning is not even great and good thing its a small serving cause its not good anyways.

Price rating: 9 out of 10. Very pricey for small amount of serving, its not even worth if cause its not good.

Get pad thai and sambal calamari! Dont get the spicy lemongrass kalbi short ribs 21 dollars and its not good! Too small servings here. 2 stars is for the pad thai!",Mark Nowell M.,"Woodside, Queens, NY",8/17/2018,2.0
We had a great dinner here last night. We were seated right away when we were there. We started with 2 cocktails on the HH- Obao Sunday and sipping emotion. Both were slightly spicy but refreshing.

"Bad enough that I took 2 bites, threw it out, and ordered something else. I've previously had the Pad Thai and found it alright, but would not recommend going near the Pad Kee Mao. Maybe it was just a mistake with my specific order? Noodles were completely pale and without any sauce, and full of very dry chicken and tomatoes. No peppers or other veg, contrary to the description.",Sarah H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1/7/2020,2.0

I came here this is the second time with my husband and my kid. They love the food here so much but I live in Brooklyn I don't have much chance to come here in the city but every time when I come here I always find Asian food to eat. First I had pho my husband had phadthai and my kid got pad se ew. All so good.... And after food we had bottle of red wine and sitting an hour then finally my kid want a dessert... I had Yuzu Wow I love it. Didn't imagine will be that good but actually it is sooo good. We will come back when we are in town.,Pornkakok T.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",11/18/2019,5.0

"Everyone have different expectations of pho but I'm from Michigan and this is the only pho in New York that has the taste of the ones I like in Michigan. Maybe not the true authentic taste or the same Spices as others. Maybe it is sweeter? I'm not sure but it hit the spot for me. :)
Also not as big as normal pho back in Michigan (which was always shareable) but it is New York City.
The back sunroom is a cool seating area too!",Stephanie S.,"Troy, MI",6/23/2019,5.0
Set a reservation through Yelp for 7:15pm and was seared immediately. Service was so wonderful and food was delicious! I got the noodles with the curry (can't remember name but it was topped with crispy noodles as well) and it was perfect especially for a winter night. Would totally recommend!,Jamy P.,"Sugar Land, TX",11/2/2019,5.0
Delicious food. Phenomenal drinks. I enjoyed the calamari and steam dumpling. The sauce that accompany the calamari is delicious. The happy hour drink menu was reasonable.

"Food: 3 out of 5 stars
Service: 3 out of 5 stars

I am visiting NY for work and this place was right across the street.

Food:
I ordered the Crispy Spring Rolls, Spare Rib on Sugar Cane Skewer (labeled as recommended by Michelin Guide), and the Pho Bo which loosely translates to Beef Pho (also labeled as recommended by Michelin Guide).

The pho was authentic and tasty. However, the quality of the beef could have been better. They also could have included more toppings. Although this was a Michelin recommended dish, I can't say this was one of the best pho I've had. If this place was in California, it would be average at best. Don't get me wrong though, the pho was still very tasty.

The spare ribs dish was also pretty good, but the taste of hoisin sauce in the peanut sauce was too overpowering. The dish wasn't bad, but I would have liked it more without the sauce.

The springs rolls were pretty good. Usually, in Vietnamese culture, there would be lettuce/veges/pickled daikons on the side to wrap the roll and then dipped in the fish sauce. Daikons were included. However, this dish only had one lettuce and it was soaking up all the oil so I couldn't use it to wrap. That essentially rendered the fish sauce useless. Dipping the roll alone in the sauce would be too salty. It would have been nice if this dish came with lettuce on the side NOT drenched in oil.

"It might be the best fusion restaurant l've ever had.My day and l were looking for pho place eventually we went to Obao where we are very impressed.
First of all -The server was very welcome and hospitality he recommended how to eat pho bo correctly ; put some hoisin and hot sauce on small plate then dipped the beef and noodles on its.Then He came to check back reversal times and let's us try any dessert finally l got chocolate forest ,was so yummy.Absolutely coming back:-)",Num N.,"Queens, Queens, NY",11/13/2019,5.0
"Michelin-starred Pho!
***
Locals
My favorite place for Southern Vietnamese pho! They have 3 locations (FiDi, Midtown East, and Hell's Kitchen). Very convenient locations, and delicious & cheap food!
***
Travelers
It's the best Southern Vietnamese pho I had in Manhattan. Midtown East and Hell's Kitchen are better locations for sit down, but Financial District (FiDi) is better for quick bites. Make a reservation as they are always packed for dinner (for Hell's Kitchen and Midtown East).
***
My Recommendation
Michelin Star? Pho? What's not to love? Their Bun are also amazing! Each location is slightly different, though. Hell's Kitchen and FiDi have Thai options. Lunch is cheaper than dinner and Hell's Kitchen has Lunch Sets with appetizers.

Pork belly is the best i ever had and grilled pork and shrimp Bun is my favorite dish the sauce that come with it's so tasty. By the way I was sitting at the backyard with 2 friends. lovely place and friendly staff. Definitely come back again.,Tom W.,"New York, NY",11/4/2019,5.0
Awesome place! Great environment/ vibes.. Food and drinks came quite despite how busy it was. Would definitely come back again!!,Kitty Z.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",11/2/2019,5.0
"This is one of my go to spots in my neighborhood and definitely my number one choice for Thai in the midtown east area. I've been here multiple times - in person and take out. I've never made a reservation here and have always had no problem coming in and sitting down. While they get busy on weekends it's never too busy.

My go to here is definitely the pad Thai. I typically get shrimp and they add a soft boiled egg which is so good! I've also gotten curry which I recommend and the dumplings and spring rolls for appetizers. The pad Thai is a little bit sweet and is more than enough food for a meal. Overall not too expensive and they're very quick. Definitely recommend!",Rachel H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",12/1/2018,5.0
"Love LOVE this place. Amazing Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. I must have had almost every noodles dish on the menu! My favorite (call me boring if you must) is the Pho. I know, I know. There are definitely other things to eat, considering their boundless menu. The Pad Kee Mao is a must try. The Kui Teaw Laksa is out of this world! The Pad Kra Prow is as heavenly as a single meal could get. Let's not also forget the drink menu. The wide variety of fancy cocktails to choose from, you wouldn't know where to start. My go to is the FLUNK FLINK because of my love for lychee. This drink is a lychee infused sake, so it's a win win for both my fondness of lychee and sake. Then of course, there's the OBAO. This drink is fiery and spicy, as you would imagine a drink at a Thai restaurant would be. It's mixed with pineapple juice and jalape√±o! All for all, this place is a must try for when you're in the area. Which theres a good news! There are 3 locations within Manhattan. So there shouldn't be any excuse to not give this place a try!",Diana D.,"Brooklyn, NY",10/27/2019,5.0

I had had khao soi, cashew chilli chicken and a bunch of other dishes over my past few visits. All of them tasted pretty good and none of the visits had any service or staff issue

Would recommend to have a reservation during peak hours, else the place is not that crowded and they serve also pretty fast",Durvank Y.,"Boston, MA",3/16/2019,5.0
"Pretty standard viet/Thai food. Pho was average, laksa was pretty watery, pork belly was prob the best but even then I've had better. We paid over $80 for two apps and entrees, which to me was surprisingly a little pricey. Not the worst I've had though",Catherina L.,"New York, NY",4/14/2019,3.0
"I've never been to the OBAO on the west side, but from what I hear, it's grander and more frequented than this location is. I've visited twice. The first time, I was seated in the back, and though it can get a little loud from the chatter, it's quite comfortable and the ambiance is good. The second time, I was seated in the front, directly outside of the kitchen/staff entrance. Thankfully it was a casual dinner and not for any occasion, since the traffic and noise in that area was very distracting.

Their happy hour prices are attractive, and the Flink Flunk cocktail I ordered was really good! The menu is a bit pricey, but given the area, and that this is one of those ~trendy~ fusion restaurants and not a no-frills hole-in-the-wall, it's to be expected. The pork belly appetizer is exceptional. The Pho Bo and Pad See Iew are alright, nothing special. The portion sizes look deceptively small, but with the generous amount of meat they give, the dishes are filling. OBAO offers select desserts from Spot Dessert Bar at a slight mark up ($12 instead of $10), but for the convenience, since there isn't a Spot anywhere close to this location, it's quite worth it. They don't taste as fresh as they would if you were to actually go to Spot, but again, for the convenience, it's fine.",Tiffany L.,"New York, NY",5/1/2019,3.0

"This place is adorable, and our server was very nice. They're pretty accommodating about the menu in regard to substituting proteins. The veggie dumplings were not my favourite balance of flavours so I'd give a hard pass on then. But the Pad Kee Mao was SOOOO friggin good! I switched the chicken out for shrimp and it took all of my might to not lick to bowl at the table after I ate every last bite.  They also have a decent happy hour with a selection of drink specials.",Aurora N.,"Miami-Dade, FL",9/19/2019,4.0

I ordered the Pad Thai that came with 6 pieces of large shrimp, and topped with a poached egg. Mixing the egg made it much creamier much was amazing!

"To start with: the A Health Score is not valid. Saturday night, 10/5, the NYC health score on the window was 'Grade Pending' & the number of violations listed on the NYC site was 44, with the majority of those violations considered ""critical"" and posted in red!
Service was gracious & efficient.  Drinks were inventive & delicious. Food ranged from just ok to disappointing!
Tofu for the vegetarian dishes only came fried - ""that's all they have"" was the waitress's response.  It tasted like they slice up tofu into cubes, deep fry them, then store them to be used when needed.  The tofu was dry & tasteless!
White rice is also 'all they have'.  In today's world who doesn't serve a brown rice alternative?!?
To summarize: I don't ever have to eat there again, but now not be able to trust the Health Score rating on Yelp is the larger disappointment!!",Marcia S.,"Bayside, NY",10/7/2019,2.0

The dumplings were pretty good but there was a tangy spice.. so like a spicy ness of 5/10. Pretty sure shrimp pieces were in there. Had some hard crunchy pieces in them. Taste was 7/10.

Shrimp roll was one roll cut into 2 pieces. It was not even made fresh. Quite horrible.
Bun Bo Hue had so little noodle in it. Among the pork pieces, only 2 were properly sliced nice pieces although wafer thin, they were mixed with other pieces which resembled leftover pieces.
All in all, not nice food. I will not be going again.",Eve M.,"Rugby, United Kingdom",10/14/2018,2.0
"Met a friend here for lunch and it's packed in here! They do community seating if you don't mind sharing a table.
The menu is pretty standard Thai fare with a lunch special page. We had the Pad Thai noodles and the grill pork and shrimp over vermicelli and both were delicious.

The pad Thai comes with a runny egg on top which you can mix into your noodles so if you don't like runny eggs, be sure to tell your waitress or waiter!
The grill pork and shrimp was super flavorful, on top of salad greens and vermicelli with a side of fish sauce. There's only 4 piece of shrimp but the pork is pretty generous for lunch. We were both really full and the price was as expected in that neighborhood.

Service was ok, not super friendly but mostly due to the high turnover and packed lunch crowd. You sit down and you have to order quick or you might have to wait a while for your waiter or waitress to come back. The food was worth it so I don't mind going back to try their other stuff.",Janet Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/12/2017,4.0

"I've been to OBAO several times with my coworkers and friends. I tried a good selection of their menu already, but never really got their soup noodles. So I stopped by to give it a shot. It's definitely a great spot to come by for it's lunch specials before 4PM. It gets pretty crowded during the lunch hour rush, so don't expect service to be the best. I came around 3PM and there were barely any customers and we still didn't get the best service, we had to wave down or call our waitress a couple of times before we can order or get our water replenish.

My friend got the Pho Bo, the soup was a lot different from what you usually expect from a Vietnamese restaurant. There was a strong cinnamon after taste from the soup, the meat portion wasn't that great. (Pretty little IMO) I got the Bun Bo Hue, loved the noodle consistency but the meat portion could be better, there was only two slices of beef and maybe 4-5 pieces of pork belly.  

I would come back for their OBAO chicken or chicken green curry (way better than the noodles in my opinion)",Sue C.,"New York, NY",10/17/2017,3.0
"My boyfriend, cousin and I stopped by OBAO in Midtown for a nice dinner. The atmosphere was quite crowded. After they seated us in the front, I asked if we could sit closer to the back where it seemed to have been more populated. The food was honestly sub-par. I love Thai food, its my favorite, but this place definitely missed the mark. I ordered the thai curry, the spices just weren't all there. My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken and he was very very disappointed.

"We have ordered Pho from Obao before and decided to have a meal at the restaurant this time.

We started with a glass of wine that wasn't worth the happy hour $5. It was flat, tasteless, watered down something. We next ordered the papaya salad that was okay but I have had (and made) much better papaya salads. It is not that hard to make it more flavorful.
The dumplings were nice, filled with chicken and something else. It came with a sweet sauce that was nice.
The basil fried rice had too much pepper in it. But it wasn't bad. Again basil fried rice is my favorite food and I have had so much better than this.
My friend ordered the steamed fish (sea bass) with lemon garlic. It was brilliantly steamed and came very presentable.
The pad kee mao (or mow) tasted exactly like the basil fried rice. Too much pepper and same flavors. Again, I have had better.
The saving grace was the dessert- chocolate forest I think it was called. Basically chocolate mousse with some pistachio ice cream.

Okay food, not bad at all, not great either, decent service! But I doubt going back.",Dolonchapa C.,"New York, NY",10/17/2017,3.0
"I never really write bad reviews but this was just disgusting. I've been to another OBAO and it was great so I thought I would try this for lunch since it's near my office. I ordered the pad see ew off grub hub and was super excited to try it. This dish was so salty that I literally cannot finish half of it. It's soaked in sauce that had way too much salt.

"I stopped by for a bowl of pho and some spring rolls after work one day. I am giving this place 2 stars for the service the waiters provide and the quality of the food. The first item, waiters, I had to ask multiple times for items and they kept forgetting, napkins, water, etc.. The challenge here is they were not busy, so I have to ding them for that. Second, the quality of the food. The spring rolls came out first, they were packed with noodles and very little else, the menu clearly stated it came with scallions and none of them had scallions. Moving on tho the Pho, the broth was light and clear and the meat was tender, the challenge is it lacked depth and for the price, it should be a very deep rich and flavorful broth. The upside, the noodles were cooked perfectly for my taste. Hope this review helps you make a decision.",Steven G.,"Las Vegas, NV",7/24/2019,3.0

For appetizer, I tried the egg plant, it was pretty good but the portions were not as big as the egg rolls. For entree, I got the beef pad see ew. I was not impressed. The beef was a little burnt. The noodles had a smoky taste. At first I thought it was their signature flavor but then I figured out why. They precook their food early in the morning and keep it warm in the pan. When I received my pad see ew, it was warm and not hot like I usually get at other restaurants. The service was good.

"Had lunch with a friend.  Ordered spring rolls, pad thai and drunken noodles.  The drunken or Pad Khi Mao, was fantastic, and truly one of the best I've had in the city.  Also liked the fact that they serve in these nice sheet bowls, which was a nice touch.  The $5 sake happy hour glasses were a bonus.  My friend thought his Pad Thai was a bit soggy, but was delicious nonetheless.  I cant wait to return.",Samir S.,"Hoboken, NJ",4/5/2019,5.0
"Beautiful decor. No wait at peak lunch time which is a plus. Everyone around me ordered the pho but I got the drunken noodle instead. Super salty, seriously, they can get away with half the sodium. The dark soy sauce overpowered all the other flavors in the dish. The heat is on the milder side. Maybe Obao is known for their pho but I would not recommend the pad kee mao. Quick service. Dark lit if you are dining near the entrance.",Sarah C.,"Boston, MA",4/23/2018,2.0
"How is this $40? Get out of here. Smallest portions. Taste was mediocre. So much for trying something new.

"Experiencing Pho and noodles from the west coast and midwest, particularly from Cali, I did not get my money's worth whatsoever. I ordered the bun bho hue, and literally finished my bowl in about 2 bits. $14 and I  have never been so disappointed before. But I suppose that's New York City For you.",Kat L.,"Garden Grove, CA",5/31/2019,2.0
"Great signature pho (but forgot the hoisin and shiracha).  Red coconut curry Laksa combo was good too. Crispy spring rolls, OK.  Definitely worthy of a fourth star if it wasn't  for  being 'sold out' of their popular items like Spare ribs on sugarcane skewers and grilled pork and shrimp Bu'n.  Tried out Uber eats delivery service for this order, $18 not to have to walk in the rain was worth it.",Mike A.,"New York, NY",5/30/2019,3.0

Would highly recommend!",Jazmins K.,"Queens, Queens, NY",6/17/2018,5.0
"My wife's cousin that lives in Queens told me to try out this place. He said it's a very popular place. It's a Asian fusion restaurant. It's a nice place, with fusion cocktails and the food was okay. I felt like this place was trying to be a upscale Vietnamese fusion restaurant with decent cocktails. It was a little over priced, and I felt there are a lot more better restaurants in NYC.",Cheyne T.,"Honolulu, HI",4/9/2018,3.0
"Love this place! I just came here for a quick meal before heading home. Don't feel like cooking today. I was surprised when I got my order a few minutes after I had ordered.

Obao has the best Pad Thai in NYC. I love the way they put an poached egg on top of Pad Thai. Shrimps are huge and I really like the flavor of the sauce. Not too sweet or too salty. It maintain the authentic tastes of Pad Thai.

The atmosphere is great too. Industrial style with warm light. I will bring my friend to hangout here.",Pinetawee S.,"Blue Ash, OH",6/14/2018,5.0
"Easily some of the best Thai food I've had in NYC.

and it was yum! HAHAHA.",Benjamin K.,"New York, NY",6/14/2018,3.0
"The food was very authentic and tasty. The waitress was very attentive, alittle too attentive that i felt rushed. The place looked pretty nice and comfortable, they even have a small outdoor seating area. The coconut milk soup noodle was very good, the flank steak vermicelli was good too.

"Fun little Thai place on the East side. It's bigger than it seems with a larger back room. Fun and delicious cocktails, yummy food, and good service made for a great meal experience. The only downside is the noise level which is high. It may have been due to a large loud group but seems like the usual. Definitely give it a try.",Vanita K.,"PRINCETON JUNCTION, NJ",9/28/2019,4.0
"Terrible service.

When I first politely asked for a side of fish sauce (dipping sauce for egg rolls) they tell me its in the bag (it was not in the bag).

I asked again for the dipping sauce, then they start smirking and almost humiliating me, and ask what fish sauce im looking for.

As i explain what i wanted continue to look at me as if im annoying them and taking away their time. FYI there isnt single customer at the moment.

Because I guess seemed to have an annoyed look, the manager reluctantly says sorry, while my waiter just stares at me as i leave.

1. Don't stare at a customer as if they are dumb when they ask for something(may not know the exact term for the sauce).
2. Don't lie to a customer that its in the take out bag when it isnt there.
3. Don't blame a customer for the restaurant fault and just a simple apology would've solve everything.

The food is decent here, but I will not be eating here again unless they do something about their subpar customer service.",Patrick H.,"Deerfield, MA",7/16/2019,1.0
"This is my third time in NYC but first time here at this restaurant. I was not very hungry but just want to eat something nice after a long day.

The food here is impressive! Calamari had an unusual but flavorful sauce. It also came with sweet and sour dipping sauce which worked great together . I also ordered Basil fried rice without tomato, onion and bell pepper. It came as I request and still tasted pretty good.

Dessert menu looks pretty good. Unfortunately, I couldn't eat any more. I'll try their dessert next time.",Wanchee J.,"Hoboken, NJ",6/14/2018,5.0
Really good food! I got the vegetable pad Thai with no egg as well as some vegetable dumplings. Really liked the flavor of the pad Thai although I felt that it was a little dry so would have liked some more sauce on it. The dumplings were cooked perfectly and came with a good amount of soy sauce. The environment was really nice too we were seating in the corner which we actually really liked with a good view of the beautiful dining room.,Sydney W.,"The Waterfront, Jersey City, NJ",7/2/2019,4.0
"Meh, honestly not that good. We got the pad Thai and the ""poached egg"" was literally RAW. The noddles were undercooked and the steamed dumplings were blah. Also, there's a funky smell at this place.",Tesi Z.,"Miami, FL",6/22/2019,2.0
"We got the Pho BO, vegetarian dumplings, and Pad Thai. Good food, service and ambiance. The food was presented very athletically pleasing (we were so hungry forgot to take a picture). They have happy hour with many options. Not very vegetarian and vegan friendly because most of the sauce is made with fish. I think it's a new restaurant right now because the grade is still pending and the walls have patchy paint.",Kai P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",11/4/2018,4.0

"Ratings were so good that I wanted to enjoy this place, but the noodles were so sweet and gooey that I couldn't get past 2 bites before tossing the dish. Please make your dishes less sweet, Obao...",Jamie K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",10/1/2019,2.0
"We came on a Thursday evening and were seated promptly with our reservation.  There are a lot of natural wood accents and trees in the back seating area.  It is fairly dimly lit which made reading the black menu somewhat difficult.  There were some items on the menu that were colored over with a dark marker which felt like an unprofessional way to indicate that a dish is no longer available.

We started with the vegetable dumplings which were very yummy with crispy sweet potato inside - would definitely recommend.  The order comes with 5 bite-sized dumplings and a small shallow dipping dish of soy sauce which is a little awkward to share as an appetizer.  For entrees we got the Pho Ga (chicken pho) and a vegetarian curry over white rice.  Both portions were large enough for a dinner portion.  There were no sauces or condiments on the table and none were brought out with the meal so we were unable to add any additional flavors to the dishes like soy sauce, fish sauce, etc.

Overall it was a fine dinner, but this location does not live up to the great indoor ambiance or quality of the other OBAO locations in the city.",Gianna S.,"New York, NY",11/27/2018,3.0
"This was my haunt back in 2015. My friends and I would walk from 6th avenue to 3rd just to get the Obao Chicken. So good. So scrumptious. They don't serve this dish anymore, though. Sad to hear this.",Leana L.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",3/6/2019,4.0
"I have the say the ambience is mediocre and so is the food. I think OBAO tries to do too many things at once. Viet pho , Thai food, and some Chinese dumplings also ? Everything was mediocre. The pad Thai was quite soggy and the poached egg did not add anything to it.",Judy H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",8/11/2018,3.0
"I walked by this spot and stepped in to a nice host who affirmed that I can order take out. Looks like it has a potential for a nice drink at the bar and eat some good pho.

I ordered the pho ga (chicken noodles) and the tastes were great. Little details that stood out was that the jalape√±o was actually spicy and the lime wedge actually squeezed out some juice. It's the little things that count and I think think pho has got it going on. Plus I'm full.",Julian N.,"New Providence, NJ",4/14/2019,4.0
"Had a pretty good dinner at OBAO the other night. The food was tasty - especially the basil noodles. Omg spicy AF!

For entrees, I got the chicken red curry and fellow Yelper, Alexis, got another kind of chicken with a unique name I can't remember. They do not have brown rice???? Ughhhh

My curry was ok. Lex's food was ok. The basil noodles were DELICIOUS!!! I'm dreaming about them!

OBAO also offers happy hour until 7pm featuring (small) $4 beers and $5 wines.",Gigi A.,"Manhattan, NY",10/4/2016,3.0
"Dined with some friends here for weekday lunch. Crowd was the usual work crowd with lots of people but surprisingly short wait. They turn over tables fast. Cute and trendy space. Seemed to be a popular for lunch. Menu was just okay. Lunch special doesn't really come with additional appetizer unless you pay extra $4. Got the pho bo for $11. Steep for noodle soup but you're paying for midtown prices. It was just okay, portion was alright, but nothing to leave you breathless. Broth was decent.",Shelley L.,"New York, NY",7/31/2018,3.0
"I love the idea of this place, im really hip interior with a very curated set of top dishes from many cuisines, however they failed to deliver, at least for the bun bo hue I ordered. The bun bo hue was worse any most pho places I have been too, they noodles were way overcooked, it was soft and really broken so there were no long noodle strands, it also came with a tiny amount of noodles that I have to ask for an additional portion because it wasn't enough. The soup flavor was okay but nothing special. The Khai soy my girlfriend got was quite good tho, but overly the bun bo hue was a disappointment and hence the 3 stars.",Chenkai L.,"New York, NY",8/4/2018,3.0
"Went here for a work lunch a few weeks ago - The menu is a pretty standard Thai menu.  However, everything we had was really delicious!

Grilled pork, spring rolls, beef, etc!  All so very tasty!   The prices are right, especially for midtown.   Seating is a bit cramped and the high top tables/chairs seem like cheapo stuff, but oh well.",Chris S.,"Astoria, New York, NY",1/4/2018,3.0

"I love their Pho, but it keeps getting pricier every time I order it. I'm going to have to find a new place to get it if they keep hiking up the price. I bought it toThe soup is amazing, I'm less enthused about the rest of their offerings.

Just finished eating my take out Pho Bo. It's even more expensive than last time. They were skimpy on the meat. I'm probably going to start cheating on them with other restaurants.",Elizabeth A.,"Bronx, NY",10/13/2018,3.0
I have been eating here for years. The foods and services here are getting worse and worse each time. Especially the take out  foods are really bad:(. I ordered their signature Bun with steak and it looks like someone's left over with tiny bit of beef (not even a whole slice of beef). I ended up throwing it away and bought something else for lunch at a different place. Total waste. I think this would be my last visit to them. Good luck to them.,Will L.,"Staten Island, NY",8/30/2019,1.0
"Love the food and vibe at OBAO! I had the pork belly as an app and the Bun with Pork and Shrimp. Yum! The meats (pork belly and pork) were seasoned very well. The drinks were also pretty good! The service was pretty slow, but I was there with a small group, so we were taking our time catching up! I would definitely be back!",Tia G.,"New York, NY",12/26/2018,4.0
"I thought I had already found the best pho in the NYC ( Tha'i Son in Jackson Heights) but imagine my surprise when I realized ""OBAO"" Was a Thai & Vietnamese place. I was told that they serve great pho here, so I have to give it a try to see how it matched up to Pho bro!
I went with a big beef pho($13.00). it was a normal size. The broth was the most insanely good pho broth I have had. It was so rich with a hefty meatiness and a punch of aromatic. All the meats were sweet and tender. It was a small portion of protein than I used to, but that because I always have a XL bowl wherever I go (I'm a big fan of pho).
And also I got the crispy spring rolls ( $7.00 ) it was good. It made up with pork as shrimp, taro, and mushroom, eat with house dipping sauces ( I don't know the name) that a litter bit sweet.
If I lived around here, Obao 53 would be my favorite place to came everyday but I live in Queens, so OBAO will be my favorite restaurant to hang out with friends and family in Manhattan.
Will come back so soon.",Moh N.,"Queens, NY",6/17/2018,5.0
"Obao is a Manhattan staple, and as such is consistent in terms of quality across its locations. The good: excellent service, good food, and well prepared pad Thai. The food was exceptional, although a tad bit on the oily side. These are pictures of the Pad Thai and the Pad Kee Mao.",Kunal K.,"Manhattan, NY",6/19/2018,5.0
"I came Friday night with a friend and was seated pretty quickly since it wasn't that crowded. I didn't do that much research to find this place so I didn't have too many expectations. Our server was very friendly, though at times it was a little difficult to flag her/staff in general to get water refills or the check. In terms of food I got the Bun with grilled chicken which was really good. I never get vermicelli because a lot of Thai or Vietnamese restaurants either put too much or don't have enough seasoning to make it taste more than just bland. The dish was light and flavorful, though I wish the chicken was slightly more charred and cut into smaller pieces.

It was also happy hour at the time, and I ordered the mojito which was fantastic! They didn't skim on the alcohol and the muddled berries were particularly poignant. Even if I don't come back for food, I will come back to try more of their cocktails.",Erin-marie P D.,"Manhattan, NY",9/1/2018,4.0
"I've been visiting Obao in Hell's Kitchen for several years now, and have always loved coming in for lunch or dinner.  This was my first visit to Obao Midtown East and it did not disappoint!  I recently started working nearby and Obao's lunch specials are always worth it.  While the menu and presentation is slightly different compared to the HK location, it still is just as tasty and just as great!

Lunch Specials at Obao Midtown East run from $10-$12 - and my personal favorite still is the Kra Pow with Chicken.  At some other Thai restaurants it's just known as the Pad Kra Pow and you can choose your meat. The Kra Pow is made with chicken, holy basil, bird's eye chili, garlic, and onion and is truly decadent yet not that spicy. A typical Thai noodle dish, like the Pad Thai, is saut√©ed with the grain/noodle already mixed in.  With the Kra Pow, rice is on the side, so you can choose to disregard it altogether, or mix it in to the Kra Pow sauces (like I do) after you finish your hearty meal.  So good!  

The lunch special comes with a small green side salad included in the price. For an additional couple of bucks, you can add in a smaller portion of one of their appetizers.  I'm personally partial to the fresh shrimp roll.

Obao Midtown East will be a lunch staple for me if I continue working in the neighborhood - I'm so glad I had the opportunity to finally come by this location!",Adam S.,"New York, NY",7/30/2017,4.0
"Some hits and misses with Obao. The tom yum soup was amazing- a big bowl with plenty of shrimp and mushrooms, and super flavorful and tangy. However, the Vietnamese pork chop was just okay. It was good considering that Obao is more of an Asian fusion Thai/Vietnamese restaurant, but definitely not the best. There was plenty of pork, but some pieces were a little tough, and it did not come with the side of pickled vegetables that this dish usually comes with. It was literally just pork and rice- a bit too simplistic for my liking. My friend got the bun bo hue and loved the broth, but thought that everything else was just okay. That being said, this is still a solid spot for some Asian food with plenty of seating and a cute, relaxed environment. Everything is also super affordable. Would give it a 3.5 if Yelp did half stars!",Audrey T.,"New York, NY",6/24/2018,3.0

"Wow! Love it! Come here with my friends for dinner. Granted I have only ever gotten one thing but damnit it's perfect yum. I got the Khao soi chicken  with some chili on the side to make it spicy. Yes! It's spicy, so the Thai ice tea cools down my mouth perfectly.
Also, the back area is super cute. Gooooo  Try it! You'll never look back.",Hussein A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/16/2018,5.0
"What an amazing meal I just had! Thai food at its best with creative attention to detail on their presentation and extremely tasty food.

What a wonderful cozy place! Very low lighting and the staff is great! I wish I had gone into the back area; it looked lively! But I can always return! The food is delicious; the wait wasn't bad.

This Pad Thai is worth every penny! I've been going at OBAO for years but never try their Pad Thai.

"Stopped by here through a friend's recommendation because I happened to be in the area.
It's a nice solid place to come for a meal (especially recommend visiting for the lunch special).  

My friend got the Michelin recommended Bo Luc Lac.
I tried it and wasn't a huge fan of it. You can get a bit bored (?) of the same taste because it's just a lot of meat with some vegetables (rice on the side).
However, I did enjoy my B'un with grilled pork & shrimp. I really liked the taste of the grilled pork. As for the shrimp, it was good, but not many pieces. Overall, the b'un was not too heavy, but enough to make you feel satisfied.

I liked the fact that we got to sit all the way in the back. I didn't want to sit in such a dark environment inside. So, I appreciated the well-lit area with natural sunlight, but of course provided protection with the glass. I also liked the small addition of the green salad provided when dining in at the store.

The only downside would be the price. I've had cheaper for a similar quality meal and the price does add up when including tax. But, I guess it's expected of a midtown restaurant....",Olivia K.,"Queens, NY",6/30/2016,4.0

What I ordered was extremely sweet. I couldn't finish it and gave up half way. My friend ordered the Vietnamese fish clay pot dish and it didn't taste like what it was supposed to taste like. Giving this place two stars because at least hers was edible.",Mai N.,"Cityplace, Dallas, TX",7/5/2018,2.0

Oh and you like steamed dumplings this place makes them like no other. Out of the 30 Thai restaurants I have traveled to in the US this was the best I have had hands down!",Carl R.,"Manchester, MI",5/2/2017,5.0
The pho was ok but overpriced. I ordered take out couple of times and somehow the soup always spills everywhere and by the time I got it half of the soup is gone.,Arika L.,"Manhattan, PRINCE, NY",1/12/2019,3.0
"The servers are fast and the food is great.
I love the vibe here ... modern and chill.

Beef is very tasty and the selection is great!
I highly suggest trying the steamed dumplings!",Karolis T.,"Lake Worth, FL",6/21/2018,5.0
"The steam dumplings are to die for! I love it! Good thai food ever. I was meeting a friend for dinner at Little Thai, but the wait was an hour long. We were starving so an hour definitely seemed way too long of waiting. So we decided to came to Obao and walk in. It's located arould 53rd Lexington ave. Very close to subway station.
First we found no seats! But after me got two seats at the bar and just decided to orderd some drinks here before went to the table.
When we got the table our orders were taken right away, and the food was served quickly. I ordered the steam dumpling and papaya salad. After appetizers we got khaa soi. I haven't had it before but i like it!",Patty B.,"Woodside, NY",6/19/2018,5.0
"Solid place to get your Thai food fix. $12 will get you a generous bowl of basil fried rice - the dish was nothing phenomenal but will definitely satisfy your craving for good ol' fried rice. Same goes here for the pad kee mao (drunken noodles). Both dishes have just the right amount of spice without it being overwhelming.

The hidden gem here is the pork belly appetizer. I've never ordered pork belly outside of ramen/Korean BBQ places but it was the right gamble getting it here. It is much more lean than the traditional pork belly, with a crispy edge and served in a nice sweet sauce.

The staff was very cool. We dropped in on St. Patrick's day and got free shots for wearing green. :)",David T.,"Washington, DC",3/26/2017,3.0
"I really enjoyed eating here.  This is my second time coming here.  The Tom Yum soup is very, very good.  The soup has a variety of seafood, not just shrimp and the mushrooms were very tasty and fresh.  I asked for spicy and it was good!  I then had the Penang steak curry dish and I enjoyed that as well.  It looks small, but it extends in the back. It is not a large place, but it is fine.  I think there was only one unisex bathroom, from what I could see.  
The staff were courteous and the prices were reasonable.  If you love Thai/Asian fusion, come here.  It is somewhat noisy, but I didn't have to raise my voice to speak with my friend.",T L.,"Manhattan, NY",12/21/2017,4.0
"Can't say I'm disappointed. Can't say I'm satisfied. It was an OK experience. The service and dinner setting is great, but the food pales. If you're looking for good Thai/Viet food that's not too special, then this is for you. If you're like me looking for exceptional plates of the two, then  this place won't be the right match. Thai iced tea is always great, though!

For $7, the shrimp spring rolls taste as if they've just come out of the fridge. They're also nothing different from the spring rolls you can get at a much cheaper Viet restaurant in Chinatown. I rely on the peanut sauce to make this appetizer much more flavorful :)

The chicken platter is good for just that -- the chicken. The papaya salad is a 3/5 to me, though I don't really understand why it seems to be a popular appetizer here. The rice is a little too sticky, which doesn't go down well with the crispy chicken.

I'm probably biased since I didn't order the popular entrees, but I do think that lunch is more worth the experience than dinner.",Amy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",6/9/2017,3.0
"A must if you are looking to get some good Asian food, curry here is delicious.
Also great service and kids friendly.",Ar L.,"West Chester, PA",12/24/2018,5.0
"Super good food, service and ambiance! The staff was also really friendly and being there just felt good! The restaurant was crowded with lots of people, which is a good sign! but it didn't feel too stuffy and wasn't very loud. I would strongly recommend the Sambal Spiced Calamari and it is actually the best calamari I have ever had. It had a a lot of flavor which fried calamaris never have. Everything there was good and I am definitely going there again, a few hundred times!",Ishani C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/21/2018,4.0
Quick service and good food after Broadway play when help started cleaning tables and spraying chemicals on nearby tables. Never were told when place was closing only when time to order would end. Could not finish meal because of chemical taste. When we got bill automatic tip was added because we were a party of five. Finally got an adjustment to bill. But what should have been a good dining experience literally left a bad taste in our mouths. So when we did complain why did not they have help stop spraying until we left?,Steve F.,"Los Angeles, CA",11/25/2018,2.0
"I felt that this OBAO was inferior to the OBAO in Hell's Kitchen. This restaurant doesn't possess a trendy ambiance and the service/drinks here are lacking as well.

Our server forgot to give me a spoon for my pho (what?) so I had to flag down a different server to ask for a spoon. We only saw our server when we initially placed our order and when he brought us our food, so asking for sauces and more water was kind of frustrating. We also waited a while before we were able to ask someone for our check.

The pho bo was tasty and it came with a lot of beef, so I have no complaints about the food. However, I was disappointed by the OBAO cocktail here. I have ordered the cocktail several times at the other location and I enjoyed the heat from the jalapeno and the sweetness from the pineapple juice every time. The cocktail that I ordered from this OBAO tasted like vodka with jalapeno in it.

If you haven't been to the OBAO in Hell's Kitchen, I think you will have a satisfactory experience here. However, if you have experienced the food, drinks, and service at the other location, it's hard not to notice all the areas where this restaurant falls short.",Helen P.,"San Francisco, CA",2/22/2016,3.0
"I came here a few times with my coworker for lunch and I absolutely loved it. This place gets packed right during lunch time so be sure to come here early to grab seats.

This restaurant serves a fusion of Asian cuisine ( mainly Korean, Thailand and Vietnamese). Although it's a bit pricey, but I usually go for the lunch menu. Portions are big enough and the food is pretty good compared to the restaurants around the area.

This will always be my go to spot for lunch whenever I can go out.",Mei Q.,"New York, NY",2/8/2017,4.0
"Just ok. We made an early reservation and they took us 15 minutes late. When we got upstairs there were multiple open tables. The entrance was small and packed with guests. Food was mediocre. I got the Pad Sew Iew and it didn't have much flavor. Small portion which is fine. We got the pork belly appetizer which was decent. Nothing to rave about. My Fianc√© got the Pho Bo and loved it.

I wouldn't come back their service is lacking and it's not a good pre Broadway meal.",Laura A.,"White Plains, NY",11/11/2018,3.0
"The food was better than I expected, but I think it was still just OK compared to many places I've been to.

Appetizers:
Pork belly - It was your standard cha siu that you can get at any Chinatown restaurant, but only difference is that it'll cost you much more here.
Spare rib on sugar cane skewer - It was very tasty. A unique approach to having grilled meats on a sugar cane instead of a plain metal skewer.
Papaya salad - Very refreshing on the palate.

Pad see iew - It was just ok. I've had better at Thai restaurants.

Bo luc lac - This has always been my ultimate fave dish at Vietnamese restaurants. It wasn't one of my faves over here. The meat, tender as it is, was unfortunately very salty, which forced me to eat more of the white rice than I really wanted.

Matcha waterfall - Nothing in the center of this dessert gave the impression of there ever being a waterfall, or something liquid of any sort. It was actually very much overbaked and it was more a full cake than a molten lava cake. I was very disappointed with this one.

I would return just for the skewers and papaya salad, but evidently that's not enough of a reason for me to come back.",Dee D.,"New York, NY",11/30/2018,3.0
"I came here after work for a quick bite to eat little did I know it would turn into one of the most disgusting interactions I have every had. I am not one for writing reviews and understand people have bad days. But the waitress was so rude . She rushed us to order and was extremely difficult. At first I thought it was my energy and tried to change it but even the people I was eating with noticed it to. Everything we ate they rushed and was taking our plates . When it was time for the bill she pretended to care if we wanted desserts and placed the bill on the table with another attitude all of that just to hurry us up , my friend paid with card and she snatched the card machine out his hand when she found out he wasn't tipping and didn't wait to listen to the fact I was tipping not him please work on your staff .",Ashely T.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",5/6/2019,2.0
"I am on a misson to find the best Thai food in NYC, so i was bery excited to come here on Monday for lunch arould 1.30 pm. It did not disappoint and i will be coming back for tge great food, mazing decor, and wonderful lunch special prices!
Love it",Kyla C.,"Woodside, NY",6/18/2018,5.0
"3.67/5 stars. If you're in the area around lunchtime, and you're craving pho, then this is a solid option. Everything else is medicore.

Lunch is everyday from 11-4 (iirc)

Food 3/5: pho bo is the way to go here. Do not order the bun bo hue. The original standard one with (5 year ago) Michelin recommendation is decent flavor and portion. I did have to put in sriracha and oyster sauce which I generally try not to do (you want to really taste that 8 hour soup base!) the bun bo hue was not so great and there were barely any noodles! At least the value is there during lunch hours with the lunch special prices (10 for the pho bo). Frugal tip: You can pay an additional $4 for a side (ex. Two spring rolls/dumplings/other) , but if you're down to share with a friend, just go for the appetizer, which is $7 for 4 (or more depending on what) pieces. The ""free"" salad was just plain gross.

Service 4/5: fast and efficient. Not anything spectacular but no complaints.

Atmosphere 4/5: decent decor. Seating space the smaller side. No complaints.

I'm pretty disappointed because I remember really liking the 9th Ave location. Probably wouldn't go here again unless craving pho while in this area.",Sarah H.,"New York, NY",3/11/2017,4.0
"Me and my girlfriend went to obao on Wednesday night without any reservation and we got seated right away!  We ordered the pork belly and dumpling for the appetizer , SUPERB!!  I had padthai for my entree and my girlfriend got the pho beef. My padthai came with poached egg on top--- WOW! Love it!  My girlfriend also said her soup is one of the best soup she's ever had.  The service is pretty fast and friendly. Too bad we didnt have enough room for dessert. Will definitely be back!",Thanut R.,"Queens, New York, NY",6/14/2018,5.0
"OBAO is one of my favorite Thai & Vietnamese restaurants in New York. I love their pho so much especially pho bo! With their unique beef broth, the noodles and everything it's just perfect! Really good for this cold weather. Another dishes I love is pad thai and bo luc lac. They're incredible!! The staffs are very nice and friendly, the service is quick I don't have to wait too long to get a table or sometimes when it's really busy I don't mind sitting at the bar. They also have unique cocktails too I love their Fig-A-Tini sooooo much gotta order it every time I'm there! Highly recommended",Tinker B.,"University City, Philadelphia, PA",12/10/2018,5.0
Yum! Always a favorite. Bo luc lac is amazing! Tom yum is solid. Curry is tasty as is eggplant tofu and pad kee mao. Pho Bo is unmemorable.,Amelia M.,"Manhattan, NY",6/6/2019,5.0
"Another solid and cheap restaurant for lunch in the Midtown East area. I've been here once before for dinner and once for lunch.

The Beef pho is decent, but it lacks the tendon and different types of meat, so it was kind of boring. I also tried the OBAO chicken, which on the menu lists only 20 are made each day. This dish consists of a roast turmeric-rubbed chicken thigh with a turmeric coconut rice. The chicken was somewhat dry at some parts, but the skin was crispy. I thought the coconut rice tasted more of turmeric than coconut. Both times I tried a braised pork belly dish which were both really tender and fatty. The gave us this side made of frozen vegetables with shredded coconut at the beginning of the meal. It was a really strange combination.

It gets crowded during lunch, but the restaurant is bigger than expected. The restaurant is divided into three areas of seating. The front with the bar, the middle with the largest tables, and the back room where this huge tree takes up the middle. Not sure if I'd come here for dinner, but as a lunch option this place is great.",Jocelyn K.,"Jersey City, NJ",9/6/2015,3.0
This place is amazing. Staff is friendly and food was good. Pad thai always be my favourite! Definitely will be back. Recommended!,Navinta S.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",5/13/2019,5.0
"After reading about the great pho, I opted to try it for lunch takeout.

The lunch special is definitely not worth the price even if it is ""as low as $10"" The portion sizes are tiny. I wasn't charmed by the broth and the meat was tough. Dining in seems to have normal sized portions though.

A $4 side of fresh shrimp roll is really just one shrimp roll. The ingredients may be decently fresh but it's very simple and imho not very good.

You may be wondering about the ordering experience. During peak lunch time, it's very rushed and awkward to wait essentially in the doorway. The wait staff is good considering the volume of orders but you'll have to make sure they keep you in mind.
If you're using Eat24, you may run into trouble since ""it doesn't work well with their system."" I couldn't tell if this was an excuse from the servers when they couldn't find my order or if it's actually the case",Kangqiao L.,"New York, NY",10/13/2017,3.0
"Very very classy and hip atmosphere. The food display impressed me a lot. I wish we took pictures before diving in but the display and quality of the actual dishes were too good to wait. Of course, like many other ""modern viet places"", I didn't expect much authentic and richness of the food. To be honest, coming into this place was more for the aesthetic and pleasing to the eye rather than actually for the taste hehe. I would've given OBAO a 5-star rating but since the my pho and vermicelli were lacking that true-viet flavor, a 4 star will do!",Cindy N.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",10/8/2018,4.0
"I've been to OBAO several times but had always gone to the one in Theater District. However, today I decided to try the Midtown location because I was in the area. Before I got there, I checked on Yelp to make sure they have the same menu. Yup, they do! Why the much lower rating though? Hmmmm... since I was hungry, I decided to still go.

I ordered the same dishes that I've ordered before - the sugar cane beef skewers as apps and the beef pad kee maow as my entree. The skewers were really chewy. The meat was on the fatty side and the texture made me think that I was eating chicken skin instead of beef. It didn't have the nice grilled taste that made me love this dish in the first place. The sauce didn't taste as delicious either. Very disappointing.

The entree was good. A bit sweeter than usual but they added pickled mango (I think?) as garnish and that helped balance the taste. If it were not for the entree, I would have given a lower rating.

Surprised that the quality is so different than the other location. Since it's part of the same chain, I'd think that the taste and quality would be on par. That explains the much lower rating, I guess. Will still go to the one in theater district, just not this one.",Tanya T.,"Winston-Salem, NC",2/8/2017,3.0
"Walked passed this restaurant while walking to the train station and was drawn into it because of the lunch special. The lunch special is probably of good value. The restaurant is clean, nicely decorated, with a lot of tall tables a few bar seating. The service is great, the waitress are very nice and are good at recommending what's good on the menu. However, ""what's good"" can be very subjective.

I am Thai and this thai-vietnamese restaurant was a big disappointment for me. The waitress recommended me pad Thai which I was very excited to try out as she mentioned that it's one of the best dishes there - and as a Thai, I would like it. To my surprise, the pad Thai came out very soggy, it was super flavorful in a bad way - so sweet yet very sour at the same time. It's hard to describe, but it was just so bad. It's definitely not authentic. I did not taste any peanut at all and there was a sunny side up egg inside! What!? No pad Thai in this world does that - this is definitely not authentic. The only good thing about this dish was that they gave 4 big pieces of shrimp in it.

Would not come back again.",Nicky F.,"New York, NY",10/23/2017,2.0
"Came to the restaurant with friends and the food was good, I was going to leave 3.5 stars review until I found out they overchaged my credit card just tonight...............

We had total 7 people having dinner as a group, we have 3 pairs of couple and 1 single girl, since what we ordered were very close in price and we also shared 2 appetites, we decided just to split the bills. Since the waitress told us 3 cards per table is maximum, we split the bill in to 3 cards, and I offered to pay for my girl friend. I didn't leave a tip because another 2 cards of our dining party covered that. The charge shows up today on my card somehow was mysteriously added $6. I should only paid $79.5, but they charged me $85.5 and it is a confirmed transaction so I have to contact bank to dispute it. This is totally unacceptable.

I don't think I will ever return to the restaurant again, as I will never think this kind of fraudulent behavior will happen in a restaurant located in Midtown East. I also urge you to check your credit card statement,  if you have recently visited this restaurant and you paid by credit card. Please do keep your receipt with you and check your on-line transaction to make sure they did not overcharge you.",Irene C.,"Fort Lee, NJ",1/13/2017,1.0

"I've been to OBAO for lunch a couple of times and love it! Their service is super quick and the food is delicious. The restaurant is also pretty large so there is usually not a long wait for a table.

I love their pad thai. It comes with a poached egg but they will do it scrambled if you ask. The meals come with a side salad that has a mayo-like dressing- interesting but tasty. There is an outdoor area which is great during the summer. Note there is a $15 credit card minimum so bring cash if needed!",Jen F.,"Monmouth County, NJ",1/9/2018,4.0
"....like a moth to a flame... That was the look in his eyes...frozen like a deer in head lights, unable to move and wondering...'Did I do that?' [fade to black]

Upon entering Obao, you're first hit with a teeny bar/dining area and you wonder, how on earth will a party of 10+ fit?  But then the hostess guides you towards the larger dining area in the back and a few steps further there's a garden patio to easily accommodate another slew of patrons during the warmer months.

As previously mentioned in another review by my fellow Yelper, Eva T., when a suggestion is made by MyG Nadia Z., you pay attention. Nadia certainly did not steer us wrong. We all decided to order a few apps of which I throughly enjoyed the Crisp Pork Belly, which I think was the best out of our app choices which also included, crispy vegetable spring rolls, glazed chix wings and pork wrapped sugarcane skewers. I liked the pork but the sugarcane had no sweetness or flavor at all. For some sugary sweet authenticity, they needed to procure their sugarcanes from the guy selling fruit out of the back of his van between Bronx River Ave and the Bronx River Parkway. That would've added that much needed dimension to those skewers.

The few apps we devoured was just a way to whet our appetites further and prep us for our main course. More than half of our party ordered a Pho. Which was one of the main reasons we signed on to this invitation. This was my first encounter and most def will not be my last. I ordered the Bun Bo Hue which was a coconut cream broth, which was much lighter than expected, but full of all types of new flavors to my tastebuds. I added all the side accompaniments, the leaves, citrus, spices and bean sprouts, because I wanted the full taste experience. At one point I noticed that our table was quiet for a few good minutes as everyone took those moments to just enjoy their meal, and a great meal it was indeed. I would definitely eat there again.

[Fade In] ...Everyone blaring and chiming in, 'Shaft, why are you just staring at the flame, you should've been putting the fire out!!!'. Belly roll laughs all around as my signature carryall is brilliantly aflame. But thanks to some quick thinking the flame was quickly doused and the carryall survived with only a mild scorching and leaving evidence of a smell of burnt offerings to Obao's Buddha.

Needless to say, we enjoyed a great meal, but left a lasting impression as the group that almost burned down the restaurant.

"Brilliant food. Exciting vibe. Friendly staff. Reasonable prices. Fantastic place in Manhattan. Dumplings house with a unique sauce. Salty spicy deliciousness. I had to get the pork belly, again, exceptional. Then the Bo Bein hue soup...... complex broth, clean crisp flavor. Overall awesome place.",Lee W.,"Methuen, MA",10/30/2018,5.0
"This was another place that we frequented during the summer restaurant week I found on Yelp actually.  It was supposed to have really good Thai food, and also had Vietnamese food on the menu.  Unfortunately, we couldn't check out their fixe prix menu online.  However, my co-fellow and I split the following things:

Papaya Salad

PROS
-very good flavors: not too much fish sauce
-good quantity to share between two people

CONS
-it wasn't really anything outstanding.  It definitely fell short of quantity compared to a few Thai restaurants back home.  Maybe this is Manhattan and Midtown makes it served in super small quantities for plating, but it just didn't wow me.

---------

Meatball rice-wrapper appetizers

PROS
-good flavor in the meatball: well balanced when wrapped with the vegetables.
-definitely shareable between two if not three people, very good quantity

CONS
-incredibly difficult to wrap: meatballs are round and therefore, kept slipping out of the wrappers, especially since they are coated in a light sauce.  I ended up eating every piece separately as it broke and fell apart.
-rice wrappers were cut in half.  This makes it even harder to wrap.  In addition, there are different sizes of rice wrappers.  These half-sizes were from the smaller diameter wrappers.  They may be cheaper, but it was just really hard to eat this dish.

--------

Sea-bass over greens

PROS
-healthy, in the sense that it is pretty low sodium content
-fish was not overcooked

CONS
-I could cook this at home.  For one, I believe the greens was either yuchoy or gai lan (Chinese broccoli), both of which you can get for dirt cheap in Chinatown.  I'm not kidding.  They sell these for approximately less than $2 a lb, maybe sometimes as low as $1 a pound.
Sea bass can be quite expensive, but if you're going to pair it with cheap Chinese vegetables, it cheapens the dish overall.  It may have been broccoli rabe, but that's not the most expensive vegetable either.  Not to mention, the fish wasn't melting in my mouth nor could I taste the fattiness of the fish.  I almost at one point wondered if it was cod.

---------

Crispy Seafood Pad Thai: this was a very interesting dish.  I think it's supposed to mimic the Chinese dish of seafood pan fried noodles.  For one, they used fried wonton skins instead of standard vermicelli noodles.  It was more like a Chinese seafood nacho dish.

PROS
-shareable: especially if it's in taco form
-I do like fried wonton skins.  It's the same flavor as crab rangoon just minus the cream cheese.

CONS
-I was somewhat hoping of a more substantial dish with noodles.  This wasn't super filling.

Their Hell's Kitchen establishment has a better rating, but if the menu is the same, I may not give that a go when there are so many other Thai places to try.  I was warned that Thai and Vietnamese food in NYC is not the greatest so maybe I came here with too-high of an expectation.  Still worth trying out though, just don't know if I would do it again.  In addition, I was placed at a table that was right underneath an air-conditioning vent.  While I appreciate A/C in the summer, having it blast on me so much so that I got a chill/cold the next few days did not really make me any happier than having my meatballs fall out of my appetizer the night before.  And yes, I've wrapped these plenty of times on my own at home before, just not with meatballs.",Vera L.,"Manhattan, NY",9/3/2016,3.0
"I've been wanting to go here for a while and the wait was worth it.  The drinks were absolutely delicious.  I had two different margaritas and both were great. The OBAO has jalape√±o and I asked for sliced jalape√±os in the side and it was not a problem. Then i had the Comrade Party with a chili rim... yum! I was there for lunch and had the Pad Kra Prow.  They serve it in a bowl by itself and a bowl of rice which is perfect because I don't always eat a lot of rice and if it's on my plate together, I tend to overeat.",Jeanette S.,"San Antonio, TX",5/23/2018,5.0
There is nothing I can say bad about this place! My boyfriend and I went here for his birthday and had a great time !

Loved the experience.  Small and cozy.,Michelle A.,"Waldwick, NJ",3/23/2019,5.0
"I am lingering between 3.5 and 4. Since Yelp only supports integer, I would rather say that the 0.5 is for the stunning appearance of the bartender there lol.

Ordered the OBAO cocktail. I felt that it's not tasty compared to the other cocktails I had. But it's definitely a novel experience! This is the first time I was asked whether you want your drink to be spicy or not. And when it was served, it came with a slice of green pepper on top of it!

The PAD THAI is kind of disappointing. I didn't even finish it. Although it is quite flavorful. The combination of the levels of flavor is just not that appealing.

The BEST part is the crispy pork! The waitress said that it is great when I ordered it. And she did not lie. The pork was juicy, tasty, flavorful and simply fantastic! Will definitely have it again the next time I stop by.

Overall, not recommended for going all the way to this restaurant, but if you walk across it, don't miss it!",Aoshi L.,"Jersey City, NJ",1/28/2018,4.0
Great food and wonderful environment. My favorite Thai restaurant. I especially enjoyed the pad Thai and the figitini.,Chet B.,"Queens, Queens, NY",10/10/2018,4.0
"Came here for happy hour on one the freakishly humid & hot days of the week this summer. Bad idea - they have one tiny little AC trying to cool down the entire restaurant.
We were sweating when we came, and it only got worse from HH drinks. We had the red and the white glasses of wine. Only one specific type of white and red wine on the menu is available for happy hour prices (I think $5). If I remember correctly it was the pinot grigio & the merlot. I liked both a lot, but since it's hot inside, stick with the chilled whites.
I think the other HH deals were $8 cocktails & $3 sapporo. Don't quote me. I tend to stick to wine.
We only had one small dish which was the sambal spiced calamari. It has the typical texture of Thai calamari (not Italian-style) but it tastes fantastic with the spice. I loved it. But it was kind of small-portioned for the price.

I want to come back to try the other things, but maybe in the fall.",Jen P.,"New York, NY",7/26/2016,4.0
"I'm quite the health freak so I always cook for myself during the week, but one really lazy Wednesday I caved and ordered from Obao.  My apartment is literally a few doors down and a few flights up, I've passed it a million times, and it always seemed appetizing.  However, being the clean eater that I am, my Seamless order had several modifications.  I ordered the Eggplant Tofu with Spicy Garlic Entree and requested extra eggplant, light on the oil, and for the tofu to not be deep fried.  Each modification was honored and the dinner I had was absoltuey delicious, plentiful, and inexpensive!  The food was ready even before the estimated time!

I am also a huge lover of spicy food and my tolerance for it is quite high.  Obao wasn't kidding saying this dish is spicy.  I finished eating it quite a bit ago and my nose is still a little runny!  Yum!",Jackie S.,"New York, NY",2/25/2015,4.0
"My actual rating for this place is 4.5. I came here twice with colleagues for lunch, and I really like their food. But their service is not very good :/

FOOD:
OBAO CHICKEN: it's baked chicken leg with coconut rice. The chicken leg was really tendered and seasoned well. I was kinda worried that the coconut rice would be too sweet, but it was really delicious! Most salty flavor with a hint of coconut taste. Yum yum. The portion is kinda small tho, I was full but I don't think it's enough for a guy.

GRILLED PORK ANS SHRIMP WITH RICE NOODLE: I forgot it's real name lol but it's pretty good. The pork gave a great sweet-salty mixed flavor, not too much. The sauce for the rice noodle was like a typically Thai flavor. That little sour just opens up your appetite.

Thai Tea: the flavor was right on point. Not too sweet or too bland. But I think less ice would be even better when all the ice melt.

PAD THAI: my colleagues got this. They all think the sauce is too much.

SERVICE: not very good. Always rush you. Rush you to order, rush you to pay, and rush you to leave. But I guess cuz they're pretty busy but meh :/

AMBIANCE: the restaurant is really loud. It's very hard to talk. You kinda need to yell if you wanna talk to ppl across the table.",Demi Chuxuan R.,"San Diego, CA",8/10/2016,4.0
"Good classic Thai. Tasted great - not the healthiest. Pad see ew, pad Thai, spring rolls are exactly what you'd expect. Chicken curry was a bit spicy and more of a soup. The broccoli side was on the saucy side. Not bad at this price point but you probably could do a little better",Sam S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3/12/2019,4.0
"Fun abience, great food, staff friendly and attentive!  I had the chili chicken and rice and it was superb.  The prices were reasonable.  I would highly recommend Obao!",Mike B.,"Phoenix, AZ",7/20/2018,5.0
"The service here was terrible. The host told us that it would be a 10-15 minute wait to start off, but it ended up being closer to 40. When we finally went up to ask, he said that our whole party had not been there, even though I had been sitting there. While we were eating, waiters kept coming to take things from our table while we were eating. A waiter took a sauce that was specifically brought for my dish while I was still eating the dish! The papaya salad, pad Kee mao, and pho bo tasted alright, but ended up giving me food poisoning shortly after. All in all, I would avoid this place.",Helen Y.,"Champaign, IL",1/8/2018,2.0
"I've been here a number of times, both for dining in and taking out. It's my favorite restaurant in Midtown East, for several reasons.
First, the price-to-quality ratio is about the best you'll find. Michelin recommended dishes (decent-size portions to boot) for less than $15? Yes please.

Second, the simple quality of the food - I have a couple of recommendations, but you really can't go wrong. For takeout, your best option is the Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles). The flat noodles are perfect and it's just the right amount of spicy for great flavor. It also heats up well, if you can't eat it right away. In the restaurant, you MUST get the Bun. Vermicelli noodles, fresh vegetables, your choice of protein (I recommend the pork & shrimp) and broth on the side. I've found that it's not quite as good when I order it as takeout, which is weird, but in the restaurant it has always been a hit.

Third, the vibe is pretty chill. If you're sitting in the front of the restaurant, the bar and the takeout counter can make it feel a little hectic, so try to get a seat in the larger, calmer back room if you are dining in. The service is sometimes a little iffy, but it's not because they're rude. They run a crazy take out business, especially at lunch time, and it's generally just very busy. A little lack of attention can be forgiven because the food still comes out quickly.

My go-to place in Midtown and it should be on your list!",Jacob H.,"New York, NY",9/3/2018,5.0
A great selection of South-East Asian food in a casual setting. Gets very busy weekday lunchtimes but turnover is pretty quick. Staff are friendly and efficient. The Thai food is particularly on mark. Try the Pad Thai!,Joseph D.,"New York, NY",9/2/2018,5.0
"Absolutely delicious as I was in the area on business and a friend recommended this place for lunch.  This is a great place for a business lunch as the food and atmosphere are awesome. I started with the crispy Vietnamese spring rolls which had pork & shrimp, taro, mushroom, house dipping sauce. Then for lunch I had the pho bo which according to the menu is 8 hours simmered ginger-anise beef broth, thin sliced rare beef, braised brisket, thin rice noodles.

Both entr√©e's were delicious and I would absolutely come back again.",Robert V.,"Beverly Hills, CA",7/17/2017,4.0
"Good place to grab a quick bite. I usually come for work lunch or a casual dinner since they are pretty quick with coming out with the food.

I tried the short rib on sugarcane this time. The short rib was yummy but don't eat the sugarcane, as I found out the hard way. The peanut sauce on this dish is absolutely delicious.

I also ordered a pho bowl and my friend got the khao soi. Both were very flavorful, although I would recommend the khao soi over the pho.",Wei P.,"New York, NY",12/15/2016,4.0
"I went here for my birthday lunch with my work friends. The food came in a very timely fashion (we each ordered the pho). The wait staff were pleasant and attentive. The pho was to my liking and tasty as well as the alcoholic beverage ordered. With just the right amount of liquor paired with some ice, it was a great. Would definitely recommend if in the city.",Jess J.,"New York, NY",9/17/2018,4.0
"Vietnamese food in NYC is not great, especially this far uptown, but Obao meets my Viet food cravings. They have Bun Bo Hue, which is hard to find here, and it's decent. Not as rich or spicy or pungent as I would like, but still very hearty and tasty.

I also like the seating in the back a lot. Dark, sleek, and spacious.",Stephen H.,"New York, NY",10/26/2017,4.0
"I chanced it again hoping the restaurant took the suggestions from everyone. Again I'm disappointed.

Bun bo hue: I ordered the regular portion but received what looked to be a lunch sized portion. The accoutrements were old and should never have been sent out with this meal but tossed instead.

Broth this time was a bit better albeit a bit oily.
Noodles weren't broken into little pieces but came in a 1/2 portion.

Steamed dumplings: flavor seemed off. Almost had the flavor of cheese? Also, there was no chili soy sauce included.

Fool me one, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me for a fourth time and I'm the fool. Ugh.",Mimi T.,"Fairfax, VA",8/11/2016,2.0

"I was on a break from a training for work. We had limited time to find a place to eat. My friend yelped this and wala I said let's go. The place is very small.

Moved into the neighborhood and I love Vietnamese food so I ordered Pho. Very disappointed. They put the raw beef in the piping hot broth which overcooks while en route for delivery. Flavor just wasn't there either. Kind of bland. I'll keep searching though....,S. S.,"New York, NY",6/30/2018,2.0

"Friendly service nice atmosphere. Had the crispy spring rolls which were tasty. Also the papaya salad. really goo. Crunchy, fresh and a great sauce made this irresistible. Pad Thai had lots of shrimp and a really good sauce as well. Tasty little place you wont be sorry to visit. Can be a little cold when the door opens.",Michael S.,"Natick, MA",1/8/2019,4.0
"I like the Hells Kitchen branch better, but, for the price (many entrees in low teens), this is an excellent choice. Asian fusion with a lot of variety--good Pho; very good Curry laksa; excelletn salt and pepper shrimp; good papaya salad; very good basil chicken; good dumplings; ok Vietnamese spring rolls.

Good happy hour specials on drinks; lunch specials $10.

Very friendly, fast service.

Very active delivery business.",David M.,"Westfield, NJ",5/3/2016,4.0
"Enjoyed my spicy red curry and veggie pad thai. This place is quick, fresh and very tasty. I loved it!",Pallavi N.,"Tampa, FL",10/17/2017,4.0
This place was great! I went on a Thursday night so it wasn't too packed. The cocktails were delicious and the pork belly appetizer is a must try. I got the laksa noodle dish and I loved it. Will be returning for sure. Also very affordable. My entree was about $12,Nancy J.,"Jersey City, NJ",12/16/2017,4.0
"At this point, I am not even sure if this place is Thai or Vietnamese, or just simply ""Asian fusion."" I really don't like matching those 2 words.

I've been wanting to go to the location in downtown for some time now, but I happened to be in the area for dinner with a friend. The front of the restaurant is pretty relaxed and open. I like the area with the bar, because it reminds me of those restaurants on St. Marks. For an Asian Manhattan restaurant, this is pretty spacious. There's a back room, and I believe there's an outdoor garden seating as well.

We started with the Crispy Pork Belly. It was $9 and a total of 9 slices (if you consider the small piece a slice). It was pretty expensive, considering most pork bellies are served very crispy and this was nowhere as special and as close to the ones I've had. Supposedly, the Pad Thai is really good. I don't get it. Is it because the cookingware-like bowls? It wasn't as tasty as I thought it looked; not too much flavor there, but I liked the variety of ingredients.

Overall, it's a nice, casual restaurant, away from the fanciness in Midtown. I'm pretty sure the popular lunch special has more value.",Sharon T.,"Taipei, Taiwan",7/5/2014,3.0
"This place was quick, relatively cheap, and the food was great. The Pho was great and my jalape√±o drink was also lovely!",Maggie D.,"Nob Hill, San Francisco, CA",7/26/2018,5.0
"I have been skipping this place until my visit today, as my friend kept mentioning to me that food quality in Obao is going down. Today my team chose Obao as it has plenty of space; so I decided to give another try.

Ordered Obao chicken as suggested. While the chicken meat was tender; the rice was slightly too greasy for me. Overall good quality for 12 bucks lunch special.

Guess will stick with the Pho Bo next time!",Elaine H.,"New York, NY",3/21/2016,4.0
"Obao  midtown hits the spot if you're looking for Vietnamese fare. Even though the restaurant is categorized as Thai, 75% of their menu is Vietnamese.

The rice vermicelli noodles are spot on, with the right balance of nuoc'mam and chilies, the nicely barbecued marinated pork meat has a charred taste from the grill. This remind me of my childhood with all the lemongrass flavors and senses.

Staff is Thai, but cooks are Vietnamese, I could hear them talking in their open kitchen. Decor and vibe are minimalist but cozy, wait staff is mostly female and very courteous. they channel a very peaceful feel.

They have a nice Happy Hour deal with cheap vietnamese beers, if you're on midtown and into grabbing a quick lunch this place is a bargain",Jacques R.,"New York, NY",10/17/2017,4.0
"My coworkers and I decided to order delivery from here for lunch. We phoned in our order at 11:30 when it opens and they promised it would be here by 12 but it didn't get here until 1...when we were all dying from starving...big turnoff.

However, I got the Obao chicken with coconut rice lunch special for $10 and found it to be pretty tasty! The chicken was really moist and the rice had a really nice sweetness to it (I'm not sure it tasted like coconut). I was not a huge fan of the sauce that came with it because it tasted really generic but it did mix pretty well with the rice and the chicken.

I'm not sure if I'll order delivery from here again but if I'm in the area I'll definitely order in person because the food is tasty and there are a few more items I would love to try!",Kevin E.,"Brooklyn, NY",1/3/2015,3.0

"I usually come here for lunch but tonight was an old co-worker outing so to relive old memories, we came for dinner.

Very surprised how good the food was outside the typical lunch menu. Everything was spot on and delicious.

Steam dumplings were huge and tasty. Chicken wings were sweet and savory. Fried calamari with chili dipping sauce was money. Beef balls were good. Summer rolls - eh, had better. Thai people can't do it like the Viets can.

The best dish by far was the Chian Mai. A rice noodle topped with crispy egg noodle in a red curry with chicken, papaya and some type or melon. It was insanely good.

Lemongrass kalbi had intense flavor as well. Obao really took me for a surprise....",Brian L.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",5/20/2014,4.0
"I got the pho and was expecting it to be great, since this dish is famous, but unfortunately my expectations were too high. This pho was just ok. Like really just ""fine."" Not a big portion either - i got hungry again shortly after. Hence the three stars. I've had better pho in Connecticut!",Abby P.,"New York, NY",7/3/2018,3.0
"Ordered lunch from Obao yesterday because of every thai place that delivered to my office, it seemed to have the best ratings.

I got the chicken pad kee maow (drunken noodles) lunch special. This dish is typically spicy, and they warn you of its spiciness on the website, and wow- spicy it definitely was! It was still pretty delicious, just a little hard to get through without a drink.*

Luckily, I also ordered the thai iced tea. I looove thai iced tea and don't know that I've ever come across a bad one, but Obao's might be the best I've ever had (although it's possible that I just think that about each new thai iced tea I try). It did arrive in a pretty amusing container... see photo.

One complaint I do have is that the lunch specials offered seemingly don't allow you to pick your protein. I really wanted the pad see ew, but it only comes in beef? Why can't I get chicken pad see ew for $10, too? That's poultryist. :(

*Disclaimer: I am normally a medium spice type of person; if you love spicy, this should be perfecto for you.",Laura O.,"Manhattan, NY",3/15/2014,4.0
Fun place to get lunch.i loved the tomyum soup and the padthai with the poached egg.we also got the papaya salad as an appetizer. service was fast and attentive.i would like to come back to try other things from their menu.,Aditya K.,"Jersey City, NJ",7/15/2018,5.0
"So my family and I have been trying to get together a bit more frequently. These days I don't really hang out much socially, but we have committed to sharing more time together. It's important to make time for the ones who matter most.

I was trying to pick a place for my mom and sis, and after my failed suggestions of Japanese, and BBQ, my little sister suggested Thai food. I looked up a place that was easily accessible by train, and we chose this spot.

They were having a lunch special, so we picked a few appetizers from there, and some main dishes.

You'll see on the menu, that some of the items say, ""Michelin recommended,"" so I asked the server if they had a Michelin star, and she said yes. She looked very proud as she said so. Okay, cool beans. At that point, you are now being held to a higher standard. You know how that goes, right?

We were given some of those really awkwardly high seats. I asked if they had any others available, to which they replied that those were the seats they had. Later on, as I went to the men's room, I noticed that there was an entire back side to this place. The seats there were lower, and better for my older mom who has a hard time climbing into those higher seats. We had already started eating, so I let it go, but I thought it was worth noting this.

I don't know exactly , but the entire time I was there, I felt slightly uncomfortable. It was as if we weren't wanted there. Now, I recognize that this could be all in my head, but I simply wasn't getting nice vibes.

Another thing that strengthened that sentiment was at the end. Before I even finished eating, and before asking if we wanted anything else, or dessert, etc, she plopped the bill on our table. Nothing says ""Leave"" like a check being put on your table. Some places will say, ""No rush, but whenever you are ready, here's the bill.""

Anyway, I don't feel like wasting my time writing about the food, but that's why you guys are reading, so here goes.

Calamari: Probably one of the better items I had there. It was spicy, but good. My mom was also a fan of this. The breading came off easily, but I think that may have been part of the idea? I'm not sure, but the sauce and calamari was very good.

Spring Rolls: Nothing exceptional about this. Acceptable at best. It didn't taste good, and it didn't taste bad. Could I have gone without it? Sure, don't really care of it.

Ribs on cane skewer: this item is one of their Michelin recommended items. But neither my mom or sis were feeling it. I ate it, cause I'm the one buying. Hah, but I wasn't impressed with this item at all. Not sure what the michelin person was thinking here?

Cashew chicken: My main dish, this was also one of their better items. The chicken was nice and crispy. Peppers, cashews and onions accompanied this one, along with a side of rice. Pretty good dish. Quite filling.

Coconut juice: the juice was good. It had a nice couple of coconut chunks in it, and some good flavor.

Overall the food was okay. My sister seemed to like her shrimp dish, and my mom liked hers too, albeit while saying it was too spicy.

The final thing I'll say on this place is that considering that they have a Michelin star, one would expect that they'd be a bit more accommodating to older people, and go a bit further in making you feel welcome. I wasn't feeling it there, but hey, that's just me.",Angel R.,"Kew Gardens, NY",2/5/2017,3.0
"Food was okay, decent. Noodles were standard, slightly salty but good. Loses stars for bringing the check even before we asked or were finished eating. This was also during off peak hours. Extremely rude. Would not recommend or return for that reason.",Sunny C.,"Manhattan, NY",5/4/2017,2.0
They mixed up my meal and tried to make me have it. I insisted on the correct meal and my whole table was finished by the time the replacement arrived. They didn't offer anything to apologies and even included 18% gratuity!!!! I did not want to tip!  Very dishonest sharp tactics from the wait staff. Food was very good but staff are dishonest and service poor.. sad,Gary C.,"New York, NY",4/28/2018,1.0
"Underwhelmed by the service and the food both times I dined in in Obao. If it wasn't for the fact that my grandparents were visiting and the closest thing to Chinese was Thai on my block, I would had never returned.

The place was pretty empty on a Saturday night. Yet somehow we were forgotten for most of our meal. We had to repeatedly flag down our waitress just for water.

My grandma and fianc√© each ordered a pho bo with beef balls while my grandpa and I shared the catfish in clay pot and Obao chicken. Our food came out relatively quick but were just lukewarm. Our Obao chicken was dry and tasteless. The coconut rice was stale. They claimed they only make 20 Obao chicken orders per day - perhaps mine was the last of the batch and had just been sitting. The catfish had a not just fresh aftertaste but the overpowering sweet sauce did mask it a bit. My fianc√© commented that my grandma and his pho had a different cut of meat. Not quite sure why there was a lack of consistency.

Felt really bad that Obao was the place we took my grandparents to for our first reunion meal. Overpriced, inconsistent, low quality food and service. I'm not quite sure how Obao is expanding and opening new locations in the city.  Would not return.",Wing C.,"Pasadena, CA",4/13/2014,2.0
"This was a pretty poor Thai experience. The cocktails were poorly executed, the ribs on sugar cane were tasteless. The spicy crispy cashew chicken was actually pretty sweet. The basil fried rice was spicy and the shrimp in the dish were massive.... But they didn't put any salt or seasoning in to the entree.

Overall a huge disappointment. I NEVER leave a drink behind, but I had to here. Service was great though.",Biru S.,"Mamaroneck, NY",4/3/2016,2.0
Great Vietnamese and Thai place. The beef broth with the noodles and beef brisket was light and delicious.  It was not greasy at all. The service was quick and excellent.  On top of everything else the price was right since it only  $14. The restaurant was spacious and particularly crowded for a Sunday night. I will be back. This review was actually for the location on 9th Avenue.,Jay L.,"Kearny, NJ",4/22/2018,4.0
"I've only been to the obao on 9th avenue. That one lets you do reservations on OpenTable and this location does not allow that.

This is close to my new office and it is smaller inside. I had their lychee martini from happy hour and it was delicious with TWO lychees in the drink (most places are cheap and only give one) and this one was a good balance of lychee and alcohol.

For dinner, I ordered pad see mao and it was definitely filling. It was satisfying for our crave for Vietnamese and Thai food.",Jessalin L.,"New York, NY",2/2/2017,3.0
"Obao is a nice Vietnamese/Thai restaurant in midtown east with pretty cool decor. In the back, they have a garden/zen like seating area with a bar area and high tables up top.

I came dinner for one so I sat at the bar area and what bothered me a lot was right in front of me. I saw a bunch of flying bugs around the basil and drinks. I didn't say anything but super disappointing for a restaurant that I thought was clean.

Ended up ordering food anyways and got the pho bo which was Michelin recommended and it didn't dissapoint. Broth was super flavorful and could tell it was simmered for a few hours. Beef brisket was tender also which is impressive. For 11 dollars - you are getting bang for your buck.

Negative two stars for the bugs. It's middle of winter.",Kevin H.,"Washington, DC",1/27/2017,3.0

"I always go to OBAO in Hell's Kitchen, and the food there is amazing. However, the food in this OBAO is AWFUL! WORST THAI FOOD I HAD EVER TRY. Please take a look at the photo I upload before you say I am exaggerating. When I received my food - Pad see Eew. It smells like charcoal, and looks burnt. When I tried it, it was so bitter I couldn't take another bite. At first I thought there is something wrong with me because I always like the food in OBAO, so I asked my friend to try, too. She said it tastes like the burnt scrape from leftover with some soy sauce, fish sauce and Thai sour chili sauce. I never sent food back before because I think it is just rude, but I couldn't eat another bite of that. We asked the waitress when she walked by, is there anything wrong with the burnt pad see eew. And she said it is suppose to be like that. As a regular at OBAO in Hell's Kitchen, I know it is NOT suppose to be like that. I show her the burnt flat noodles, broccoli, egg and beef, she still insisted it is suppose to be like that. I had no choice but ask her if she could let the chef try and see if there is something wrong. 5 minutes later, the manager came back and told me the pad see eew is suppose to be over cooked and burnt like what it is in my plate. I was wordless and disappointed. He said he would ask the chef to make a new pad see eew for us. That's very nice of him. We sit patiently and wait for 15 minutes. A new pad see eew came to our table and it is MORE BURNT than the last one.  We really wanted to cry.  After a long week of work, we just want a regular pad see eew that is not BURNT on a Friday night. Is it that hard? Since we had already told them once, we didn't want to make a scene. The Pad see eew soy on the table when we were talking and drinking the Thai ice tea and finish other food. Thai ice tea, and pork belly were nice. Unfortunately, pad Thai is a little bit burnt, too. However, compared with the pad see eew, the burnt level is insignificant. The restaurant staff are very nice and accommodating, so we left a good tip. And we didn't feel good because we sent the food back. However, the chef and cook there need some BASIC SKILLS and TRAINING. OBAO is a chain restaurant. It is very important to provide high quality food and remain same standards along different chains. If they cannot do that, the brand image and reputation is not consistent. OBAO at this location eventually may go out of business.",Jessy Y.,"New York, NY",3/24/2018,1.0
"Food was pretty good. Ordered the pad Thai and fried banana dessert. I didn't care for the fried banana. The Pad Thai was good. 3 star rating because I ordered online and got there when my order was supposed to be ready except it wasn't ready for another 25 minutes. I just kept getting told that it wasn't ready when I would ask, instead of being told how much longer it would be or even offered an apology. Probably wouldn't eat here again.",Cassandra R.,"Houston, TX",1/29/2018,3.0
"Still my go to Asian place when visiting NYC! They have the best, and cheap pho available for $11 it come in a large warm bowl with beef and noodles and veggies on the side. Their drink specials are also great...got the blueberry mojito and it tasted so fresh and delicious with my meal. Seating in the front of the restaurant is the best, because in the back of the restaurant you can not always get a booth but instead you share a bench with others pretty close next to you.",Kent V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3/4/2016,5.0
"Mediocre. My friend and I were told to try Obao as ""it's the best thai spot"" in the area.

Ehhh. It was fine but nothing to write home about. The pad thai was kind of lacking flavor and just didn't do it for me. Our waitress wasn't very knowledgeable and struggled to answer my GF friends questions about the menu.

Definitely decent, definitely not ""the best Thai spot in the area.",Jenna F.,"Manhattan, NY",12/7/2016,3.0
"Came here on a Tuesday evening for dinner and was seated immediately. Place is casual and small, not as nice as the Obao in Hell's Kitchen. They have a great happy hour special for drinks: 4PM-7PM daily with $3 Sapporo draft, $4 wine, and $8 cocktails.

We ordered the pork belly & broccoli, pad see ew, and pork chop fried rice. Overall, the entrees were made well and the food looked good but taste-wise, they did not impress. The quality of the ingredients were sub par (broccoli actually tastes bitter, the meats were dry and tasteless and drowning in sauce, and the toppings on the pad see ew had a weird aftertaste).  

Staff was friendly, but food is atrocious. One star.",Christine C.,"Manhattan, NY",5/11/2016,1.0

"The food arrived quickly and was very yummy (mine and my boyfriend's dishes) but I really miss the old decor. They were set up for Halloween which was cute, but me and my boyfriend were seated far away from that to enjoy it as much as we wanted to.

"I've come here a couple times for lunch.
Although the backyard patio is pretty in concept... It's very unhygienic. If you suffer from mild trypophobia don't do it. Just don't. Wait for a table inside. They have the roof windows open in the summer and pollen (and who knows what else) falls in. The tree has a million holes and ants all over the roots. Im starting to feel nauseous just thinking about it. BUT stick indoors and you'll be okay!

During lunch hours the service gets very slow. Slow as in it takes 10 minutes from when you give them your card to pay until it comes back. Btw - I think the credit card minimum is $15

I have to admit, the food is really good. Just get everything with the Michelin dude next to it. Not on a diet either? Get about 3 orders of the pork belly (DROOL).

Their happy hour is awesome. Cheap drinks and eats.

So three stars purely for the food.",Khanhu V.,"New York, NY",8/4/2015,3.0
"For the price of $13 the pho bo  had very little in it. The only saving grace was the broth which was rich. If you just wanna drink soup this is a great place, other than that not the best way to spend your money.

"I arrived here on a Friday night with a friend around 8:30 pm. We were seated immediately, though the restaurant was pretty full. We ordered calamari and dumplings as appetizers, and both ordered the Pad Kee Mao for dinner. The apps were good, but the entrees were great! The portion size looked pretty normal, but I almost always finish my entire meal when I'm out and couldn't make it through this entire dish! Might have been that I filled up on apps though. The noodle, chicken, and vegetable dish was the perfect level of spiciness.

The biggest thing this restaurant has going for it is that it's very reasonably priced. Most apps are $6-10 and rice/noodle dishes and entrees were all around $12-17.",Kirsten H.,"Denver, CO",1/9/2016,4.0
"Ordered green curry.  I love very spicy food.  Have had the same dish at many different Thai restaurants and it's usually a pretty mild dish by my standards.  

This was ridiculously, you should get paid to eat this, there's been a mistake level spice.   I tried to call the restaurant about it but no answer.   A few of my coworkers got other dishes and they we're all fine.  Low rating is partly for the fact that I couldn't contact them.   I finished my food on principal and now I feel I'll.  Will not be back.",William S.,"Manhattan, NY",4/27/2018,2.0
"Came here for dinner with a friend on a Wednesday evening - no reservation but we were seated right away.

The menu is quite large (as with most Asian restaurants) and thus tough for someone like me who has trouble making decisions. Finally opted for two appetizers as I was really craving some tum yum goong - got that as well as the chicken and shrimp dumplings. I enjoyed the seafood tum yum - it didn't feel too oily, but would have been even better if it was spicier. The dumplings were not my favourite - flavourful but way too salty.

My friend eats halal - there was a decent selection of seafood dishes, and thus worked for her. She had the basil fried rice (with shrimp) and thought it was good, but nothing note-worthy.

Overall - our food came quite fast, and the service was good. Prices were also reasonable for NYC. I would come here for a quick dinner if I'm craving Thai/Vietnamese food and in the area.",Margie L.,"New York, NY",10/9/2015,3.0
There's something about this obao's pho that's much better than their other locations.  Maybe it's just better managed & the cooks care about their dishes a bit more.  The pho here is very good & is my go-to spot on the east side.  I found it better than even some of the more popular spots in Chinatown.  It may lack some meat tho so add ask for more for $2 and you'll have quite the satisfying bowl for those cold nights.,Louis T.,"New York, NY",3/3/2017,4.0
"This was my long-time lunch spot.  Love the vermicelli pork and shrimp.  Pho meat is just ok (wouldn't mind a little more tender with more variety of cuts) but great tasting soup base, more natural and less msg laden than most other pho places.

None of which matters now that I will never go back.  Had not one but TWO SHINY COCKROACHES crawling on our table mid-meal :(

FYI we sat in the front area at the tall tables along the right side of the walkway when you first come in, where there's fake grass on the wall.",Sallie D.,"Manhattan, NY",6/14/2013,1.0
"Bao!

I often get lunch here and I almost always get the Pho. This place is awesome, whether I dine in or takeout its all good.

The Pho is very good. The broth is great and comparable to more popular places in China Town. This is a great midtown gem. They also have alot of drink specials throughout the day.

The price is good and they have a lot of good deals. I will continue to eat here for sure!",Sean A.,"Yonkers, NY",5/28/2015,5.0
"Can't believe how downhill this place has gone. I have always been a fan of the food here and have been a regular for lunch for a long time. I went back today and noticed not only have they increased the cost of the ""lunch special"" significantly, but now instead of the delicious edamame it comes with, there is now a ""house salad"" which is the biggest joke I have ever seen. It is maybe 3 pieces of lettuce with mayonnaise on top of it. Just this salad shows the lack of effort or care for what they are producing as long as they can jack up the entree prices to feed their pockets. With a plethora of Thai options for half the price in the area i would and will skip this one.",Adam C.,"West Hollywood, CA",9/28/2015,2.0
Tried out Obao for the first time and odered the Shrimp Pad Thai and the Pork Belly with Chinese Broccoli through Yelp (for takeout). Both dishes were super flavorful - definitely worth the price. Portions were also great also. Definitely check it out if you're in the area.,Vivian C.,"New York, NY",1/13/2017,4.0
"i've had the pad thai with poached egg here, and while the pic looked sooooo good, i was surprised that i didn't care for it much when i finally had it for takeout.. so i haven't really been back since. but then yesterday i was craving some thai food, and the Obao chicken with coconut rice caught my eye, so i decided to try it, bc who doesn't love chicken over rice? and WOW it was soooooo good... the free soup it came with was too salty so i didn't even drink it, but the chicken was amazing... the rice was so good... and i paired it with a side of chinese broccoli, which was sooo garlicky, and sooo delicious. i think this will be my go-to dinner for the next few days. it's amazing..

what you should skip out on here:
- pho (so salty, doesn't taste flavorful)
- pad thai (not much taste IMHO even tho it looks sooo good in pics)

what you should ALWAYS order here:
- Obao chicken with coconut rice
- chinese broccoli with garlic",Cheryl L.,"Los Angeles, CA",3/26/2015,5.0
"Had dinner with with a group of ten. I made a reservation a couple days prior and was accommodated easily. We ran about half an hour late, too, but they were still very gracious about it.

We arrived and were seated immediately. They gave us the long table in the middle of the room (this east side branch was a bit small; I'm assuming their west branch is bigger.)

I got a Sweet Guy cocktail to start. It was pretty strong. I had to let my other friend finish. They got draft beers and $3 sake shots, which I think they enjoyed.

I personally got the pork chop fried rice as my entree. It was really, really good. My friends got the ph≈ç bo and they loved that. For dessert we were all super pleased to find out that their desserts are catered by Spot Dessert Bar (best dessert joint in St. Marks). I got the chocolate forest. It was great.

Only one gripe, though: I wish the lighting was a bit better. It was pretty dark and I would've had an easier time reading the menus if they added more lanterns or candle tables.",Dana R.,"New York, NY",1/17/2016,5.0
"Never tried pho until I entered this restaurant, I loved it.  Very attentive staff.  Is very crowded around lunchtime, so seating is limited.  I will be back.",Rob W.,"Seaford, DE",4/2/2018,4.0
"Absolutely love their chicken pad thai. I was never a pad thai person until I came here.
For in-house dining, they also serve a salad and will bring the pad thai in a skillet. However, when you get it delivered, you only get the pad thai.  
Beware that the egg is served sunny side up so when it's delivered, I usually ask for it fully cooked and scrambled.  
Took off a star because I've gotten delivery a few times and they've forgotten a few side items I've requested so when ordering, make sure you articulate those items.",Catherine C.,"San Francisco, CA",10/24/2016,4.0
"This is a review of my meal during lunch. My friend and I started off with some drinks-they were tasty and reasonably priced for the lunch happy hour.  
We stuck with the lunch special that came with a dumpling each and the entree. I ordered Pad khee mao and my friend ordered the pad see ew. The pad khee mao was very good (and spicy) but a tad too salty. And I LOVE salt. The pad see ew is not really for my taste because it tends to be on the sweeter side but it was good and my friend loved it. We also opted for a desert (pumpkin cake with condensed milk ice cream). It was served warm and was pretty tasty but this place loses a star for the service.
Our waitress was pretty rude overall but when we asked if we could charge our phones she said ""we are not responsible for personal property"" but said it in a rude way. Also, if was my friend's birthday and I mentioned that to her in person as well as ok the reservation and when desert came out, no candle no nothing. I was more disappointed because I had mentioned it twice. But other than that, I would definitely try this place again. Maybe their other locations and maybe during dinner.",Christine P.,"Huntington, NY",1/10/2017,4.0
"Possibly the worst thai food I have ever had in NYC and I LOVE thai food and have tried it many places. I got takeout last night. The green curry chicken consisted of three pieces of chicken with three pieces of eggplant that you had to recut they were so huge and then a bunch of broth where did the meal go? Mediocre taste.
My bf had the pork fried rice which was also unsatisfactory as well as the steamed dumplings that more so tasted like a ball of meat nothing special I would avoid this place like the plague NEVER again.",Cherie C.,"ASTORIA, NY",4/5/2017,1.0
"I love the food here, but the service has not been fantastic the last few times I've been. If you go during lunch hours, expect a bit of a wait. When you sit down, oftentimes the waiter will not bring you a menu or water until you explicitly stop them to ask for one. This type of service (or lack thereof) makes it difficult to have lunch here with colleagues from work, as things can get awkward pretty quickly.

However, if you're casually by yourself or with a few friends, this is a great place to dine. It's difficult to find a fusion restaurant that makes fantastic thai food as well as vietnamese food. The Pho Bo here is top-notch compared to other restaurants in New York City, and I spent 14 years in the Bay Area, California, so this girl knows her pho!

The thai food is equally as delicious. I would highly recommend the drunken noodles, basil tofu, and pad thai, all extra spicy!",Ha L.,"Manhattan, NY",2/17/2015,3.0
"Best Pad Thai I've ever had. Good service, good atmosphere, short wait time. Highly recommend. I'm referring to the midtown east location specifically.",Matthew J.,"Massapequa, NY",10/7/2018,5.0
The service is un friendly! The feeling i got is they tried to give you a minimum of service while demanding a big tips! They removed your dishes while you still eating without even asked! Rude attitude! Not one but all are with an attitude!!never again!!,Diana S.,"Manhattan, NY",10/5/2018,1.0
"This was my first time ordering from them online. At first I was impressed because my meal arrived earlier than expected. But when I opened it, it was not what I ordered nor what I expected. The description said it includes peanut and I requested Peanut Sauce in the special instructions. It comes with a clam sauce, which I wouldn't eat as a Vegan. When I called to notify them of this, I was told that the meal I ordered does not come with peanut sauce. I think that's something they should have notified me of before delivering. They also made no apologies for the missing peanuts that the menu description does say is included. I asked them to make me the correct meal, and the manager scoffed at me ""because of some missing peanuts?"" And he refused to replace my meal. I'm dissatisfied and a bit hangry.",Marie E.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",10/1/2018,1.0
"Ok.. So... Service was polite.

Food was good. Got spicy eggplant tofu. They steamed tofu for me. Not as spicy as I expected, but still had a good taste.

I really wanted ovaltine ice cream, but decided to be a bit more adventurous and got durian shake instead. Poor decision. It was sooo bad. It a large portion too. I have about 9/10s of it left in my fridge, that I have no idea what to do with it.

Besides the shake (which maybe someone else loves it), everything was good.",Megan S.,"San Jose, CA",4/4/2015,4.0

"I have been craving pad thai for a few days now and this place wasn't my original plan but im glad the other place was packed. The shrimp pad thai was so delicious! So flavorful and just the right amount of shrimp. And I love shrimp so I was glad to see more than 5 in the pot. Lol

I usually have to add soy sauce to my pad thai in different places where I've gone, but I didn't have too this time.! Just a little sriracha because I like spicey :) I had that with a glass of Red wine and
at the end; over all, I left truly satisfied and full! Will be coming back and bringing friends with me next time.",Tivisay S.,"Woodside, NY",1/8/2016,5.0
I really liked this place I suggest getting an appetizer with one of the lunch specials. I had the shrimp with basil lunch special and the spring rolls appetizer. The food was delicious. I took away a star because we did feel a little rushed; I understand it was lunchtime but we ordered enough food we needed time to eat it.,Brooklynbaby R.,"Manhattan, NY",7/8/2017,4.0
"great food, good prices.  

i've ordered here many times and everything i've had was good.  Obao chicken, lemongrass kalbi, bo luc lac, steamed dumplings, sugar cane ribs, wings, pho, basically everything.  Try it all.  you won't go wrong.",Russ L.,"New York, NY",8/16/2017,5.0

"Love this neighborhood Thai joint! I come here so often I'm slowly making my way through the menu. Knocking off a star for the rude staff. They like to rush you even when the restaurant is empty.

Hits
+ Spicy Lemongrass Kalbi Short Rib: Fresh Chili, Sweet Onions, Sesame Soy Sauce Marinade. So good!! Comes out in a sizzling plate.
+ Pho bo: Thin Sliced Rare Beef, Braised Brisket, Rice Noodles, clean tasting Beef Broth
+ Singapore Laksa noodle soup: Shrimp, Pork Belly, Buck Wheat Noodles, Spicy Coconut Curry Soup, Red onions, Scallions, Cilantro
+ Chiang Mai noodle soup: Rice Noodles & Crispy Egg Noodles, Red Curry Chicken Ragu, Pickled Mustard Green, Papaya Chunk, Carrot, Scallions, Cilantro
+ Pad See Iew: Beef, Fresh Rice Noodles, Egg, Chinese Broccoli, Mango Kimchi
+ Shrimp Prik King: Comes with plenty of shrimp, string beans, bell peppers and curry past
+ Clay Pot Catfish: The fish was so tender and flavorful. Caramel Sauce, Steamed Bok Choy, Bell Peppers, Onions
+ Pork Belly with Chinese Broccoli: Hard to mess up pork belly. Solid dish

Misses
- Beef Panang: The beef was so tough and barely edible
- Obao Chicken with Coconut Rice: The chicken was a little dry and the entire dish lacked flavor, I had to drench it with sriracha
- Laos Beef Salad: Portion is tiny, not that memorable.",Julia Z.,"New York, NY",1/12/2015,4.0
"This place offered lukewarm, overpriced pho (Vietnamese noodle soup) and laksa. The flavours were not legitimate and the worst part - I got food poisoning from the laksa and threw up.

"Worst Cashew Chicken you can ever eat.. Ordered Cashew chicken, while eating came to know 90% of it was Chicken skin deep fried and made crispy enuf to make it taste like charcoal. Near non-existing white meat in it. Only good thing about was cashews in it. Can't comment on other Entrees but stay away from Cashew chicken unless you want to know how Charcoal tastes.
Oh and on asking staff if they have combo, mix two entrees option, you might trigger sarcastic giggling and laughing amounst staff (one girl at the counter and other manager), so better don't inquire about the menu items, just blindly order.  Thanks",Vikas V.,"Jersey City, NJ",3/6/2018,1.0
Probably the worst green curry I've had. Please remove this from your menu or make it better. Wish Yelp had a feature where I can block restaurants from my search result list.,Michael K.,"New York, NY",8/29/2017,1.0
"Great-tasting food! More like 4.5 stars but service could be better - for example, our appetizer came but then we had to flag down someone else for utensils & plates...

We started with the Crispy Vietnamese spring rolls - hot, very crispy, and chock-full of meat. Delicious, but a bit too meaty for my taste. The Thai iced tea was AMAZING!! Not that sweet, with a perfect proportion of cream/milk to tea.

For my entree, I got the Grilled Pork and Shrimp vermicelli noodles - SOOO GOOD, especially with the sweet, tangy sauce that it comes with. Tastiest Vietnamese dish I've ever had - can't go wrong with it.

My friend got the Thin cut Vietnamese pork chop, which was actually just 8 huge, not-so-thin pieces of meat and a bowl of rice - no veggies or anything else. I liked the pork in my dish more, since it was sweeter - this one had a smokier flavor. Still good though, just too much meat and not much else.",Andrea L.,"Cambridge, MA",5/25/2015,4.0

The Pho is solid, as well as the Standard Thai Noodle dishes.  Still haven't had everything on the Menu but this is a great place to get your Thai fix at a very reasonable price.

Did I mention the atmosphere?  Well I have to let you know the back outdoor area is pretty stinkin cool! My co-workers and I frequent this place for little get togethers, and I never get sick of it.

Bottom Line: great place with great prices for Thai enthusiasts and noobies alike!",Antonio G.,"Long Island City, New York, NY",4/2/2017,5.0
"Came here for lunch. We had a reservation so we were seated quickly. It was fairly busy but they took our order and served us fairly quickly. The dining area is quite cozy though a bit cramped.

I definitely recommend getting the Chiang Mai noodles. Its a spicy soup based noodle that comes with chicken. It has vermicelli and some crispy noodles as well. It was so good that I plan to go back to their 9th Avenue location just to eat it again.",A C.,"Brooklyn, NY",6/12/2017,4.0
"Been here three times and really like the food here.  This location also has a back room with more seating which is nice.  Very clean, restrooms are clean, service has always been very good - staff is friendly and helpful.  I've ordered take out here (weeknight around 8pm and they were very quick.

The Food
Spare Rib on a Sugarcane Skewer - this is AMAZING, especially if you are a meat fan.  I feel like this is a must try! I am not a huge meat person, especially if there is fat on it, but this was very uniquely prepared and had very delicious flavors.  

Sambal Spiced Calamari
Great flavor, tender calamari, good size portion

Crispy Spring Roll Lettuce Wraps
AMAZINGLY DELIVIOUS! Getting them every time I come back!

Pho Bo
It's hard to find good Pho in New York - often times the closest thing is Korean Pho, which I think is mehhh ...so far this is the best PHO I've had in New York (I'm from California and they have some of the best Vietnamese food in San Jose).  I'm not a huge fan of the meat that comes with the Pho - it's a little fatty for my taste, but I can pick around the fat and make due.

Vermicelli Noodles
I don't know if I was just craving soup when I ordered this, but I wasn't a huge fan.  My husband and the other person we went with loved this dish, but it was just mediocre to me.  I will have to try it again and update my review accordingly.  You can add a half order of Crispy Spring Rolls for a few extra dollars - they're so good, I would always do this!

Singapore Laksa
Noodles with coconut curry soup - we got this to go and the portion was huge! Loved the curry flavor and had a generous amount of meat in it.  Will definitely be ordering this again when I am craving curry soup!

Would definitely recommend this place to others and come back here again - for the quality of food you're getting and the portion size, I feel like the prices are very reasonable.",Klarissa L.,"New York, NY",9/16/2014,4.0
"This is our go to place for lunch from work. It's a typical midtown joint, quick service, a good lunch special and decent enough food.
My favorite thing to order here is the spicy Phoo. The meat is tender, the broth is spicy and tasty and the fixings are great. I have tried their rice paper rolls, their Pad Thai on some occasions but I think their Phoo is still the star of the show. They have lots of seating, even a garden in the back so the chances that you will get a place to sit even during the crowded lunch hour are pretty good. Try this place for a decent lunch if you are in the area. They also have branches.",Ashish D.,"Manhattan, NY",9/26/2016,3.0
"After reading a couple great reviews I decided to try Obao for pick up on my way home from work this evening. Since many referenced the Cashew chicken that's what I tried. It was terrible. The dish consisted mostly of peppers, onions. There were about six tiny pieces (strands, let's call them) of chicken which could not even been identified as breast meat, dark meat or meat at all. The sauce was salty for my taste, as I was gulping water for the rest of the evening -- only after eating less than half of the dish before discarding. Disappointing",Nick P.,"Manhattan, NY",10/5/2017,2.0
"This is now my second time coming here. It was just as wonderful as I remembered! The first time I visited the Hell's Kitchen kitchen location which had a very cool vibe. Everything was decorated beautifully and seemed very upscale. Midtown location was much more relaxed, beautiful earthy decorations, big wooden tables, and what i believe was a patio. This was the perfect ambience for meeting up with an old friend.

We started with drinks. I ordered the fig-tini. Get this drink! It is by far the best cocktail I've ever had. It's fruity and refreshing and they don't skimp on the alcohol. We shared the beef skewers appetizer which was so tender and flavorful. Perfect for sharing - we each had one skewer. I then had the Pho Bo which seems requested often and friend had the Bun Bo Hue. Broth flavors were really developed and meat was good quality. We finished with dessert and decided to go different with the black rice pudding.

Overall, good dinner, good service (who really helped with friend's peanut and shellfish allergy), and am excited to come back to try more of the menu!",Maggie C.,"Washington, DC",7/26/2015,4.0

"Food: The chicken with cashew nuts is tasty, but be prepared to ingest enough salt to dry the sea of tears that will follow due to the fact that the glasses of water you are gulping down are not enough to satiate your thirst from eating the damn thing in the first place.  It is salt-tee ! Thankfully there is a bowl of white rice that accompanies the dish.  If you are like me, and do not usually eat rice when out, then you will learn to get over that dietary prohibition quickly.

Initial Service: Speaking of quick - the service was generally fine.  We got in early around the 6 pm early dinner hour. ""Hellos"" all around when you get in.  They try to push people to the front of their restaurant, which is fine - don't be afraid to say you want to sit in the back.  Once seated, we were greeted with the happy hour specials from a waitress that, based on her interaction, was super busy.  We put our order in and did not have to wait long for our app.

App:  Chicken and shrimp dumplings.  See, above, re: salt.  Not as salty as the main course, but salty nonetheless.  Generally good.  Comes with soy sauce.

Main course: you've heard my experience.  My wife got the pad kee mou.  My wife liked her dish in general.

Service Leaving: The ambient tables got full. When leaving I asked for my food packed.  Before my wife could have asked for hers packed, the waitress was off.  When the waitress came back and my wife asked for her food to be packed, my wife was met with a look and just a box (it was not packed for her).",Val T.,"New York, NY",1/30/2017,4.0

Food has really gone down hill recently.  I haven't ordered seamless from these guys since Pho Saigon opened up a few years ago.   We ordered some beer noodles and the cashew chicken.

"Went Monday night 1/29/2019, the male server name Bak, or something like that, was giving me an attitude, I ask him a question whether the noodle are serve cold or hot, he pause for a long time and look at me like an idiot, then tell me it's not cold or hot.

From that point on, I decide to give him 1 cent as his tip. When the check comes, I don't have 1 cent to give him so I gave him 10 cents.

Then he has the guts to ask me why? I told him he was rude. The 2nd time his attitude was rude, lol. I guess some people just don't learn lol.

Anyway, the fat girl actually serve the food to us, she was nice, I told her Bak was rude, she actually apologize and I believe, went and told him.

I definitely recommend getting the Chiang Mai noodles. Its a spicy soup based noodle that comes with chicken. It has vermicelli and some crispy noodles as well. It was so good that I plan to go back to their 9th Avenue location just to eat it again.",A C.,"Brooklyn, NY",6/12/2017,4.0
"Been here three times and really like the food here.  This location also has a back room with more seating which is nice.  Very clean, restrooms are clean, service has always been very good - staff is friendly and helpful.  I've ordered take out here (weeknight around 8pm and they were very quick.

The Food
Spare Rib on a Sugarcane Skewer - this is AMAZING, especially if you are a meat fan.  I feel like this is a must try! I am not a huge meat person, especially if there is fat on it, but this was very uniquely prepared and had very delicious flavors.  

Sambal Spiced Calamari
Great flavor, tender calamari, good size portion

Crispy Spring Roll Lettuce Wraps
AMAZINGLY DELIVIOUS! Getting them every time I come back!

Pho Bo
It's hard to find good Pho in New York - often times the closest thing is Korean Pho, which I think is mehhh ...so far this is the best PHO I've had in New York (I'm from California and they have some of the best Vietnamese food in San Jose).  I'm not a huge fan of the meat that comes with the Pho - it's a little fatty for my taste, but I can pick around the fat and make due.

Vermicelli Noodles
I don't know if I was just craving soup when I ordered this, but I wasn't a huge fan.  My husband and the other person we went with loved this dish, but it was just mediocre to me.  I will have to try it again and update my review accordingly.  You can add a half order of Crispy Spring Rolls for a few extra dollars - they're so good, I would always do this!

Singapore Laksa
Noodles with coconut curry soup - we got this to go and the portion was huge! Loved the curry flavor and had a generous amount of meat in it.  Will definitely be ordering this again when I am craving curry soup!

Would definitely recommend this place to others and come back here again - for the quality of food you're getting and the portion size, I feel like the prices are very reasonable.",Klarissa L.,"New York, NY",9/16/2014,4.0
"This is our go to place for lunch from work. It's a typical midtown joint, quick service, a good lunch special and decent enough food.
My favorite thing to order here is the spicy Phoo. The meat is tender, the broth is spicy and tasty and the fixings are great. I have tried their rice paper rolls, their Pad Thai on some occasions but I think their Phoo is still the star of the show. They have lots of seating, even a garden in the back so the chances that you will get a place to sit even during the crowded lunch hour are pretty good. Try this place for a decent lunch if you are in the area. They also have branches.",Ashish D.,"Manhattan, NY",9/26/2016,3.0
"After reading a couple great reviews I decided to try Obao for pick up on my way home from work this evening. Since many referenced the Cashew chicken that's what I tried. It was terrible. The dish consisted mostly of peppers, onions. There were about six tiny pieces (strands, let's call them) of chicken which could not even been identified as breast meat, dark meat or meat at all. The sauce was salty for my taste, as I was gulping water for the rest of the evening -- only after eating less than half of the dish before discarding. Disappointing",Nick P.,"Manhattan, NY",10/5/2017,2.0
"This is now my second time coming here. It was just as wonderful as I remembered! The first time I visited the Hell's Kitchen kitchen location which had a very cool vibe. Everything was decorated beautifully and seemed very upscale. Midtown location was much more relaxed, beautiful earthy decorations, big wooden tables, and what i believe was a patio. This was the perfect ambience for meeting up with an old friend.

We started with drinks. I ordered the fig-tini. Get this drink! It is by far the best cocktail I've ever had. It's fruity and refreshing and they don't skimp on the alcohol. We shared the beef skewers appetizer which was so tender and flavorful. Perfect for sharing - we each had one skewer. I then had the Pho Bo which seems requested often and friend had the Bun Bo Hue. Broth flavors were really developed and meat was good quality. We finished with dessert and decided to go different with the black rice pudding.

Overall, good dinner, good service (who really helped with friend's peanut and shellfish allergy), and am excited to come back to try more of the menu!",Maggie C.,"Washington, DC",7/26/2015,4.0
"My wife suggested we walk a few blocks to this place, what a gem, it was off the hook, salt and pepper shrimp were amazing, the food came out so quick it's as if we called in the order",David P.,"San Clemente, CA",7/31/2018,5.0
Their Fig a Tini specialty drink is insane.  Nice friendly wait staff and very close to Times Square.  We came here after finding on Yelp and it's great!,Amy F.,"Houston, TX",12/18/2016,5.0
"Food: The chicken with cashew nuts is tasty, but be prepared to ingest enough salt to dry the sea of tears that will follow due to the fact that the glasses of water you are gulping down are not enough to satiate your thirst from eating the damn thing in the first place.  It is salt-tee ! Thankfully there is a bowl of white rice that accompanies the dish.  If you are like me, and do not usually eat rice when out, then you will learn to get over that dietary prohibition quickly.

Initial Service: Speaking of quick - the service was generally fine.  We got in early around the 6 pm early dinner hour. ""Hellos"" all around when you get in.  They try to push people to the front of their restaurant, which is fine - don't be afraid to say you want to sit in the back.  Once seated, we were greeted with the happy hour specials from a waitress that, based on her interaction, was super busy.  We put our order in and did not have to wait long for our app.

App:  Chicken and shrimp dumplings.  See, above, re: salt.  Not as salty as the main course, but salty nonetheless.  Generally good.  Comes with soy sauce.

Main course: you've heard my experience.  My wife got the pad kee mou.  My wife liked her dish in general.

Service Leaving: The ambient tables got full. When leaving I asked for my food packed.  Before my wife could have asked for hers packed, the waitress was off.  When the waitress came back and my wife asked for her food to be packed, my wife was met with a look and just a box (it was not packed for her).",Val T.,"New York, NY",1/30/2017,4.0
The dumplings were good but when you ask the waiter for a simple bowl of pho with chicken and you get curry soup then they want to charge you for it.  Will not go back.  Still feeling sick from it.,Peter D.,"Santa Monica, CA",11/6/2017,1.0
I got a terrible server. Extremely poor service. Will never be here again. And will not recommend to any of my friend.,Zhang L.,"Manhattan, NY",6/30/2017,1.0
"I was so excited to eat here last Friday for lunch. going there for a business lunch is not recommended, at least not in the summer. they do not take reservations during lunch time and there is no AC.    therefore I cannot give them 5 stars.  however, the wait for a table for 2 was not long and the food itself was quite delicious and portions are a good size.  also the the order of food arrival was not correct. we got our drinks followed by our main course, then the appetizer came. we weren't even offered dessert and was left the check upon the clearing of our dishes. good thing I was full and wasn't going to consider desserts. I'd probably return to try more dishes, but definitely not in the summer when AC is definitely lacking. it was a good 85 degrees I there.",Macy T.,"Tarrytown, NY",7/26/2016,4.0
"Came here with my boyfriend on a Friday night at 7pm without a reservation but was seated immediately. The service is excellent and quick. The food was absolutely delicious, namely the pork chop fried rice and Pho Bo. I also had the fried pork belly as an appetizer which I highly recommend. Will definitely come back again!!",Malorie M.,"New York, NY",4/29/2016,5.0
Food has really gone down hill recently.  I haven't ordered seamless from these guys since Pho Saigon opened up a few years ago.   We ordered some beer noodles and the cashew chicken. All of the flavor and nuance in the preparation is gone.  Very dissatisfying.,Armen N.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",9/3/2017,1.0
"Went Monday night 1/29/2019, the male server name Bak, or something like that, was giving me an attitude, I ask him a question whether the noodle are serve cold or hot, he pause for a long time and look at me like an idiot, then tell me it's not cold or hot.

From that point on, I decide to give him 1 cent as his tip. When the check comes, I don't have 1 cent to give him so I gave him 10 cents.

Then he has the guts to ask me why? I told him he was rude. The 2nd time his attitude was rude, lol. I guess some people just don't learn lol.

Anyway, the fat girl actually serve the food to us, she was nice, I told her Bak was rude, she actually apologize and I believe, went and told him.

Anyway, NO MO at this place, STAY AWAY.",Red G.,"New York, NY",1/29/2018,1.0
"I went for dinner on a Monday at 6PM and it was about half-full, then completely full by the time I left.

Wow!  This place is surprisingly good.  I used to live a block away and never tried it.  The exterior makes it easy to forget about.  However, the food was amazing.  I am still shocked at how great the Pho Bo tasted.  I'm originally from Orange County, CA (home of the largest Vietnamese population outside of Vietnam) so have high standards for Pho.  OBAO's dish can compete in the big leagues.  The broth was flavorful but not too greasy.  The sides (e.g. sprouts and jalapenos) were of perfect proportions.  I really enjoyed my meal.

The server was attentive.

The menu was standard for a Vietnamese restaurant.

The most memorable aspect of the interior is that they have fake grass was wall paper.  It's creative and I really like it.",Joel L.,"Cincinnati, OH",4/29/2014,5.0
"Came here twice. Their service is great and quick, and their food is tasty! I suggest getting the cashew chicken if you are not allergic to nuts. It's very flavorful and has a different taste to it. If you get any of the soups -- beware, they are pretty big in portions. The Khao Soi was good, and huge! You can definitely share it with someone if you can't eat much!",Semanti A.,"ASTORIA, NY",11/9/2017,5.0
"We were going to the 9th Ave. OBAO. One friend mentioned this one since we were in mid Town. I don't know how much difference between this two. We were 7 ppl and a bit tipsy and hungry before got there, the food was quite ok and fair price. Don't really appreciate the pho, I think pho bang is the best in town, but I really like my friend's pork belly and the curry chicken noodles if you are a fan of coconut curry. I ordered the dry noodles with pork and shrimp, named ""bun"" I think, it's at the bottom of noodles menu. It's on the sweet side, but tasty, fresh and fluffy. Wouldn't complain about it. At the same time I would not say any part of it impressed me. Probably because I like salty and spicy food more. Service is fast and friendly. A place for a easy going and fair Asian food in Mid town. Coooool. Why not try!",Xu Z.,"New York, NY",8/26/2017,4.0
"This review is from a poor experience I had eating here last week for lunch. I came here for their lunch special and everything was just as expected. I have been a customer for a few years and go to Obao for special occasions or the casual meet-up with friends because their food is great.

HOWEVER, my last experience here had nothing to do with the food. It was about my check. I hope that you all review your check before leaving this restaurant because they charged me dinner prices for lunch!! My check had to be revised twice!! First was because they charged me dinner prices for 2 entrees and 1 appetizer. Second revision was because they still charged me full price for the appetizer and it was only $3 instead of $6 because I got an entree.

Third and final straw was being given the wrong change after paying with cash. I left feeling frustrated and feel bad I even have to update my review with this.",Richel R.,"Queens, NY",1/17/2015,2.0
"I did not have high expectations when I came to OBAO since I am suspicious of all the Asian Fusion restaurants. I have to say it exceeds my expectations.

We shared the crispy shrimp as an appetizer for the table and it is great. It is slightly spicy and crispy with fried shells. The flavor is addictive. For entree, I tried their Chiang Mai Noodles, which is a savory and spicy coconut-based broth with crispy noodle on top of the egg noodles in the broth. I got my noodles with chicken and it is extremely filling.

We enjoyed the ambiance and loved the food we ordered. Will definitely come back!",Athena C.,"San Francisco, CA",11/6/2014,4.0
"Came here yesterday with a group of 9.

Our group had various orders - Obao chicken, Pho bo, Bun bo hue, etc. Food was decent but a bit overpriced. Service was mediocre

When the bill came at the end of the night, they listed the total and a suggested gratuity. When we gave them our credit card, they automatically charged the gratuity into the subtotal and asked for more gratuity on the receipt without notification. We ended up double tipping for the meal. Consumer beware of these sneaky tactics!",Jack L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4/1/2017,2.0
"Ordered from seamless and with take-out, I believe you never really get the same quality/experience as you may from dining at the restaurant. I ordered the pad thai. It's a bit weird here because at other thai places - typically, I order pad thai and select the protein I want. However, here, the pad thai came with shrimp and there was no way to choose alternative options. There was a button which allowed for the dish to be made vegetarian but couldn't alternate between proteins. Likewise, some of their other dishes like the pad kee mao also seems to have pre-determined proteins with the dish.

When I got the food, it was already starting to get cold and the pouched egg that was topped on the dish had the yolk already poked and spilling out. (delivery problems :I ). Otherwise, the pad thai was pretty good. There was a limited number of shrimp - to be expected - 5/6 pieces but the dish was relatively flavorful and not greasy. I will definitely be ordering from here again - trying some of there other dishes as well as I love thai!",Grace B.,"New York, NY",3/18/2015,4.0
"When I first looked this place up I was a little reluctant due to some of the negative reviews of this place not knowing what it wants to be and how ""Asian Fusion"" never works. Well I can confidently say that this place makes it work. The food was excellent! My girlfriend got the Pad Kee Mao with shrimp and I got the Bangkok chicken and shrimp. Both were full of flavor with just the right amount of spice.
The setting was dark and romantic, perfect for a date night. Service was friendly and attentive. Ignore the Asian fusion tag and give this place a shot, you will thank yourself for it!",Eric L.,"Fort Lee, NJ",12/6/2014,5.0
"Absolutely no complaints about this place. I went with my boyfriend on a Friday night, not expecting to be seated due to the typical weekend rush. However, we were brought to a table almost immediately!

The atmosphere is chic/trendy yet still warm and comforting, which is hard to find in NYC. We ordered the shrimp summer rolls (4 half-roll pieces) and the calamari. The summer rolls were extremely fresh tasting and the calamari was fried and coated in a sweet chili sauce - really yummy!

TIP: If you are looking for something warm and hearty, definitely get the pho! I have tried upwards of 10 pho places all around Manhattan and OBAO delivered one of the best I've had. The broth was rich and flavorful and the noodles were soft yet still chewy. Not to mention this pho is MICHELIN RECOMMENDED. It definitely lives up to that label.

I also tried the Bun Bo Hue (braised pork shank, beef brisket, rice noodles, spicy lemongrass broth). Very unique and delicious as well but I probably will stick with the pho next time.

Will be returning soon.",Wei S.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",4/4/2016,5.0
"So. Damn. Good.
I order here all the time.
Must try the shrimp and pork vermicelli noodles - perfect amount of grill/charring, and the veggies on top are crispy and fresh. A nice, light healthy lunch option.

I also love their Pad See Iew noodles, and green curry.
YUM.",Courtney H.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/20/2014,5.0
"Always a wonderful experience. The calamari is awesome! The Green Chicken Curry hits the spot. What really makes this spot work is the bartender, Cici. She has been a phenomenal hostess for our visits. Attentive and sincere. Definitely worth a visit.",Joe B.,"Manhattan, NY",12/29/2017,5.0
Decent food and ambience. We made a reservation here twice and both times did not experience any problems. Everything was smooth and food was pretty good. I would recommend their pad see ew or the pad kee mao if you are a fan of spicy stir fry! It does get kind of crazy at times due to the volume but other than that it was an enjoyable experience,Emily K.,"New York, NY",11/16/2017,4.0

Literally amazing and great prices. I got the spare rib app which is amazing glazed rib wrapped around roasted sugar cane. It was superb. I also got the papaya salad which was generous and well flavored. Then I had the curry pho which comes with shrimp and pork belly. I think it would have been better if they included an egg but it was still amazing and creamy. Had a little bit of a smokey flavor to it which was a nice touch. Also the coconut juice was authentic and fresh. I love the big pieces of young tender coconut,Kristyn S.,"New York, NY",4/8/2017,5.0
"The food is OK, especially for the price point. There's also a lot of variety - pan fried, soups, etc. Also they have really good deals during happy hour. There aren't too many places to get pho in this area, so I have resorted to coming here, but it is definitely not my favorite.

The space is nice, big and clean though!",Yoonie Y.,"Manhattan, NY",9/18/2014,4.0
"Very cozy and when you think that it's a small area you get guided to the back and realize there's more. The booths are kind of tight so be advised when bringing jackets and such, and if you want to keep warm you will because the heat is on full blast so much you feel it on your face. The food was delicious, very flavorful. Try the dumpling appetizer it was one of my favorites, and I had the CHIANG MAI NOODLES- if you like spicy and curry this is the dish for you, loved every sip and for dessert we had the chocolate forest and the banana lumpia- very good with their own homemade ice cream, just be advised the chocolate forest is very decadent.  I would come back here to try out the lunch menu.",Marlena R.,"Queens, NY",1/27/2016,4.0
"Pho in the Midtown area! Whooo!

Cold draft coming in every 5 minutes from the outdoor seating area because some people be crazy wanting to sit outside during single digit temperatures - Noooooo!

Ironically, the people sitting outside had direct access to heat lamps, and they were stripped down as if it was summer outside. WTF.

I ordered the grilled pork and shrimp vermicelli and my coworker ordered the lemongrass bulgogi. As usual for a Vietnamese restaurant, the grilled pork chop was juicy and flavorful.  The shrimp, not so much. A bit mushy for my taste. The bulgogi with lemongrass however, is a fusion made in heaven. Usually, I think bulgogi is a bit too sweet, but with some lemongrass and probably fish sauce, it became a savory sweet combination that was perfect with a side of rice.

OBAO is definitely a bit on the expensive side for pho, and my coworker almost froze to death in here, but otherwise than that, the food is solid and I'd come back.",Vicky L.,"Jersey City, NJ",1/23/2014,4.0
"Was looking online for kimchi fries, seeing as I have friends from out of town who LOVE them. We were excited to see them on the menu for OBAO. When we got to the restaurant there was no kimchi fries on the menu & when we explained to the waitress that we saw them on their official website's menu she just said ""No we don't have that."" as if she didn't know what they were. Despite not having what we came for we decided to order other things. This might just be me but it raised a huge red flag when our food was brought out less than 5 minutes after ordering it. I'm not sure how it's possible to prepare all this food in such a short amount of time. I got the basil fried rice--chicken was very tough and tasted reheated. My friend got the dumplings and crispy vegetable spring rolls. She said the dumplings were okay but spring rolls were absolutely drenched in grease. Tried blotting with a napkin and it went straight through. My other friend got the fresh shrimp rolls and said they were okay. Upon my friend getting her $9 check we were informed that each check is a $15 minimum which we were never told about and the waitress was very hesitant to make an exception. I'm not normally one to write a negative review but this whole experience just really rubbed me the wrong way.",Kelsey G.,"Baton Rouge, LA",7/8/2018,1.0
"Came here for dinner with a girlfriend and found the food and service to be okay.  The restaurant is surprisingly much bigger and longer inside than the outside.  I sat down and asked the waitress what she recommended for meat and she suggested the Vietnamese style pork chop.  It came with about 3 thin slices and a small bowl of rice.  I guess for $13 it was reasonable for Midtown.

It wasn't that crowded which was nice for conversation but I feel like it's Chinatown quality food with a bit of a midtown price tag!",Kimberly L.,"San Francisco, CA",9/4/2014,3.0
"I can't say for any other dishes they sell here but pho was one of the bests I've had (I had pho bo). The rice noodles were very chewy, broth was tasty, and the portion size was just right.

"There aren't that many southeast Asian restaurants in the area, so this is a nice find. The food is good and the price is right. My favorite would be the bo luc lac- the beef was tender and tasty. I wouldn't say this place is the test Thai or Vietnamese food I've had in New York...however, it's definitely worth a try if you're in the mood for some Asian when in the area.",Diane L.,"New Hyde Park, NY",1/4/2016,4.0

"Came for dinner last night, and they have pretty great food for a good price! We came late, at 10 pm, so the restaurant was fairly empty. They have a big room in the back to seat many people. They have 5 things on the menu that's Michelin recommended, so we ordered two of those. One was bun (Vietnamese cold noodles) and the other was some kind of steak with rice. Both were very delicious, and I'm sure that it would've been even more delicious if we came at a normal dining hour! I've had bun in several other restaurants, and obao served a very tasty one with lots of fresh veggie and not dry chicken. Would def recommend.",Laura P.,"Stallings, NC",5/21/2016,5.0
"Honestly, I am stunned by the poor reviews here. We live in the neighborhood, and LOVE dining here. They've always been a solid choice for dining out. Lunch specials are great (you might experience a $1-2 discount from the regular entree price), but I will say their salads are a bit sad looking. Happy hours mean discounted cocktails, and I actually find their drinks to be enjoyable (maybe it's because I enjoy my cocktails ""fruity"" and tropical drinks hone in on this). We've pretty much tried everything on their menu. Their pad thai was a solid choice but too sweet IMO. Their clay pot cat fish was flat in flavor and tasted like food designed for those without teeth. Their namesake chicken was very dry and not flavorful. Our winners are the Chang Mai and Kui Teaw Laksa noodles ... We legit order it EVERY time we come. I used to enjoy their calamari but I'm starting to find their dipping sauce to be too sweet .. So one star off for these disappointments. Nevertheless, I will continue to support this business because of the amazing Chang Mai and Kui Teaw Laksa .. Yummm! I would recommend checking Obao out for those two dishes if you're in the neighborhood!",Jenn G.,"New York, NY",3/30/2018,4.0
"OMG!!! So I have been wanting to try Vietnamese Pho soup for a few weeks after seeing the story about the Giant Pho Bowl being served, but I wanted to have the soup somewhere good so I wouldn't be turned off with a bad experience. On this cold New York Day I ordered from Obao my first Pho soup with additional Beef Balls and a side of steam dumplings. The site gave 10% off for direct order which I liked. On to my soup which I wished I had taken a pic of before I inhaled it all. It was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING, from the broth which would can just have on its own to the noodles and meat. Most of all what I love is the fact they sent extra hot sauce on the side. I love spicy food and generally places always forget to send the extra sauce I request but upon seeing it I was Thrilled. Btw this was delivery and I food Came Hot too which was a plus.
I was so overwhelmed with the taste from ginger to the different garden seasoning in the bowl. Once you go Pho from Obao you don't go Back. I'm so full I haven't been able to eat my dumplings as yet.",Jay B.,"Bronx, NY",2/13/2017,5.0
"I was visiting New York for the first time with my father, and decided to stop into Obao for dinner after reading about it online. We weren't sure exactly what to expect, but were curious and decided to give it a try, and it was one of the best decisions we made that whole trip.

We started with the chicken satay, which was amazing and both dipping sauces tasted fantastic. After a while of reviewing the expansive menu, I ended up ordering the Clay Pot Shrimp and my dad got the Pad Ka Prow. I don't hesitate to say it was one of the best meals I've ever had. The glass noodles were cooked perfectly, with just the right amout of vegetables and shrimp, and were absolutely delicious, with a lovely gingery flavor. My dad loved his meal as well, agreeing it was one of the best he'd ever had. Another awesome thing is that it was not too expensive at all, a very reasonable price for what you receive. Thank you OBAO for introuding me to fantastic Asian cuisine, and we will definitely be back on our next visit to New York.",Maggie C.,"London, Canada",3/15/2015,5.0
"Came for late dinner one night after craving thai food all day at work. Ordered pad thai, some cubed beef dish, spring rolls and some tupr of thai drink. The drink was very good but didn't have enough alcohol. I could barely taste the rum. Adding the poached egg to pad thai was a nice touch but didn't improve the dish for me. For some reason, it was very watery and gloopy. The spring rolls were nicely fried and inside meat was tender. Overall, service was great and my tummy was satisfied but the food left a lot to be desired.",Laura Y.,"Mountain View, CA",4/3/2016,3.0

"Third time here and still my absolute favorite thai spot in NY!!

Must get:
+drunken noodles (get 2, because it tends to go fast)
+basil tofu (was a little sweeter than usual this time, but still delicious)
+basil fried rice (spicy and good ratio of veggies/meat)

Cons:
-somewhat slow service to get our order placed / get condiments since we were sitting near the back

I always look forward to eating here when I am in NY and can't wait to be back!",Anu P.,"Philadelphia, PA",10/26/2015,5.0
"Warning - this food is damn spicy!!! -  but damn good. Friday night Obao was PACKED to the point there were people waiting to get in and seated. Its a small restaurant but fits a good number of people.  it is mostly table service but also a bar where you can eat. The staff were attentive and efficient. I ordered the Vegetables Tofu Red Curry, it was a so good I could not stop eating it - I had to force myself to halt because it was so hot and I was so full. They have 3 really good draft beers on tap - enough to satisfy the average beer drinker. All in all, good place to go for a good meal that is not overpriced. I recommend making a reservation though - if I had not done so - it would have been likely I would have not been seated without a long wait.",Robyn A.,"New York, NY",1/28/2016,4.0
"The menu wasn't too bad, easy to choose a bunch of dishes. The dishes were quite tiny, on the exception of the Pho.

My sister had ordered Thai Ice Tea without milk, but they gave her the drink with milk but when reminded she wanted without, they said it was pre-made. I believe that was a miscommunication on their part, they should have informed her when she ordered without milk that it was pre-made (they did take it back and removed it from the bill, for context, my sister is lactose intolerant).

Finally, the meal is over, we take out the cannoli's I had bought for my dad's birthday (my bad I didn't call them ahead to mention the outside purchase). But they said, no outside food is allowed, which is understandable, but they changed it to say they're not allowed to have candles. Confused, but whatever, they were kind enough to allow us to eat it there and so we did and left

Overall, the food was tasty, we ordered about 10 dishes for a family of 6 and the bill was quite low to my surprise.",Louise C.,"Manhattan, NY",12/4/2015,3.0
"Noticeably different from the Hell's kitchen branch, which is much better. The menu options are more limited at this location (no kimchi fries). A positive thing is that there wasn't a wait when I arrived at around 7pm for dinner. My friend ordered the pad thai, and the quality was a lot worse than when I ordered the same thing at the other location. The shrimp was either undercooked, or not fresh, because it was not good at all. The poached egg was also completely cold in the inside. The yolk should be runny, but not at a temperature where it feels like it came straight out of the fridge and onto the plate. The bun bo hue was decent, but the spice mixture on the side does get overpowering, so I would recommend adding less. It wasn't terribly spicy. The pork was very tender though. Overall, decent, but I would prefer the other location next time.",Annie K.,"Manhattan, NY",4/13/2016,3.0
"3.5 stars! Drink happy hour: $5 specialty cocktails & wine w/$2 draft beer!

Nothing great about the location, but very clean and not too crowded seating. The grass on the walls was creative, not sure how cozy it would be to sit next to it, but we sat in the very front where the wall recessed and was wide open. It felt so nice to have a cool breeze on such a humid day.

Lovers of chicken pad thai we tend to order in every new place we go. Not a fan of the poached egg on top, the slimy coating did a number on my senses and my taste buds and I wasn't able to finish the dish. The spice was a little on the weak side, I don't know if ordering a 6-7 (out of 10) seemed too high for me, but there was no kick to the spice. The noodles were cooked perfectly. I regret not speaking up and requesting a scrambled egg rather than poached, but now I know for next time.

The portions were perfect and all the other food, those sitting around us, looked spectacular!",Lindsy H.,"Dallas, TX",4/29/2012,3.0
Over priced. B√∫n noodles were overcooked; pork was charred and unedible. Service was good--too bad food is below standard compared to other resraurants of the same category in the area.,T C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/2/2018,2.0
"I am a pho addict and come here for lunch all the time. The soup base is ok (not the best I've had but pretty decent), so I'm here regularly.

That said, I think the service leaves something to be desired. The restaurant was super busy today, the order took forever compared to usual, and  the pho came out cold. I typically order the rare beef on the side and cook it in the broth so the beef is extra tender, but today the beef couldn't be cooked because the soup temperature was off. I mentioned that to the waitress and asked for a cup of hot soup so that I can cook the beef some more. Unfortunately, I'm told, the soup would be $3 extra. I politely reminded her that I'm only asking because the soup was cold, to which she replied that she checked and the soup is hot. Not sure how she could have checked my soup temperature while I was cooking it, but here's a place that I won't be returning to again.

If you're looking for pho, try The Spot instead!",Stephanie H.,"Fort Lee, NJ",6/7/2017,1.0
There are 2 OBAO's and literally both so yummy! Love the chill vibe and the PHO soup is just perfection. I ordered beef and i don't normally order beef I usually order chicken but it was perfect. It's hard to find good pho soup spots away from home and this is my fav in NYC. I'm so thankful for this location. I will definitely be coming back. Great service and you will get your food right away... You can also make reservations but we just walked in and everything was so quick anyway.,Johanna M.,"Los Angeles, CA",12/28/2016,5.0
"This was my first time trying Thai food and it was such a great experience, that we went back 3 days later. The first time I ordered the fried shrimp which was extremely flavorful. I shared with my husband who also agreed that this was probably the best fried shrimp he's ever had too. Word of caution, they leave the shell on, which was another first for me. I didn't feel comfortable allowing our kid to eat it as you have to be mindful of the shell. Our kid ordered the thin cut Vietnamese porkchops and really enjoyed his meal. Then my husband had the chicken basil rice. On our second visit, we both ordered the shrimp basil rice which was spicy and awesome. I could easily see us coming back here again.",Rebecca C.,"Alexandria, VA",3/29/2017,4.0
"Never dined here but ordered many take out & delivery. Their pho is pretty good but there are some days where soup has no flavor compared to another day. Otherwise, their dishes are alright and not too pricey.",Soo S.,"New York, NY",5/26/2017,4.0
Really a 4 and a half star place. Waitress was hot. Pork chop fried rice was banging. Service was fast. Price was decent. Definitely recommend.,Andrew S.,"Bronx, NY",6/27/2017,4.0
"Cheap and good. Delicious.
This place is kidna cool, I like the seating area at the back with the glass roof. I was able to check whether it was still raining outside but looking up at the roof.
For appetizers, we had the sambal spiced calamari, which wasn't very spicy. It was delicious and soft!
I had the pad kha praw with chicken for my entree. They do not have brown rice here. It was pretty good, though it was a little too spicy for me!
I plan on trying their other dishes. I think this place is supposed to be a Thai restaurant, so I wonder why they serve pho, which is Vietnamese. They also have some chinese dishes and malaysian dishes. I don't really go to a Thai restaurant to eat other types of cuisines, therefore I will just stick to their Thai dishes.",Stephanie Q.,"Boston, MA",8/6/2013,4.0
"What a terrible restaurant. Over an hour after my order was placed, these jerks called to inform us that we were ONE block outside their delivery radius and therefore they were cancelling our order. Really not the end of the world if you can't deliver to our address, but a remotely decent person would've called within a few minutes of the order being placed, rather than AFTER the food should've already been delivered.

Despite that, the food here isn't great. The lemongrass kalbi was decent and the ""Vietnamese"" (aka ""fat white kid""--lots of cream and sugar, no condensed milk) coffee was drinkable, but the shrimp pad thai was a bunch of noodles stuck together with what most likely was peanut butter. No flavor other than peanuts, and I'm sure the noodles were left out for a few days. The pork belly appetizer was slabs of barely cooked pork fat, absolutely no meat. The fried portion tasted like the oil was rotten, and really was inedible.

Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this place, they're awful.",Jackie S.,"Manhattan, NY",8/11/2015,1.0
"I feel like the reviews for this place are mediocre but we were right nearby and I took a chance. The ambiance of this place is great and I really liked the back room. The service is really fast too. The pho was quite good but they skimp on the meat. The broth was definitely tasty though. I also tried the pad sow with beef and mango. This dish was extremely delicious. I don't know what they put in it but the perfect combination of sweet and savory with high quality ingredients of the bok Choy, beef, and mangos. I'll definitely be returning for this dish. The cocktails aren't too bad either and with some priced at $8, this is a bargain for Manhattan. I also saw a big group here at a large long table in the back and it seems like a great place for a big party. I'll be back here soon!",Melissa S.,"Manhattan, NY",12/29/2015,4.0
"Good Pho made with good ingredients. While the broth was really good, once I got home I started to feel a little sick because the soup taste just lingers and makes my stomach really heavy. This happened every time I order Pho from Obao- not sure what is making their soup so dense. But I am probably not going to have it again.

The Pork Belly with Chinese Brocolli was pretty good. Crispy charred pork belly served on a bed of spicy veggies. They give the tiniest bowl of rice, which was just not enough for the entree. I had to order more, and it cost a lot for another little bowl of rice.

Service is okay, had to flag down the servers a couple of times.",Tiffany C.,"New York, NY",2/12/2014,3.0
"Not sure if this place is 100% authentic Thai food- BUT it tastes great, which is why I am giving it 5 stars.  I have definitely had better in the midtown area on the west side of Manhattan but for some reason on the east side there is a distinct lack of good thai restaurants (also why this place gets 4 starts-- all geographically relative).  If you are in the area and too lazy to go west for more authentic places, give this place a go-- the food is pretty tasty.",Sky A.,"New York, NY",12/8/2016,4.0
"I ordered take out from here for dinner and I liked this place!  

Crispy Fried Tofu - I love tofu and I love it when it is fried.  This hit the spot at $5.00.  It was a good appetizer although I wish the portion size was bigger.

Eggplant Tofu with Spicy Garlic Entr√©e - I love eggplant with tofu and garlic and this dish hit the spot.  Everything complimented each other really well and I'd order this again.  The only thing is that this dish was $13 and it was a little  on the expensive side considering this dish did not have any protein.  You can easily get a similar dish in chinatown for $6 or so.   I would suggest you spend your money on something else.

Thai Iced Tea - This hit the spot and tasted like your usual thai iced tea.  It was $3.",Angeline C.,"Brooklyn, NY",2/5/2014,3.0
"I made a reservation earlier in the evening for dinner at a later time and was so happy I did. When we arrived it was very busy, but we were immediately ushered to the back of the restaurant to a beautifully set table waiting just for us. The staff was sweet and we had some delicious drinks in no time. We all ordered an appetizer, and I also ordered a soup. I loved the spring roll and the sauce was perfect. Also the Tom Yum soup was nose running good. Two at our table had the sugar cane spare ribs, they were a hit and miss. The flavor was good, but we got tired of chewing on the sugar cane. Then some of us had mains, although I was really too full to enjoy it. I had pad thai, my usual for this type of restaurant. It was good, very good, but I brought most of it home. Hubby had a basil chicken with rice. He enjoyed every last morsel. This is a fun, delicious restaurant with a great staff and prices that are in line with other Thai or Vietnamese places. I will certainly go back and work my way thru the appetizers. When I do return I will have soup and two appetizers. They are more fun for me to eat and I can get Pad Thai at other restaurants, but you can't get Tom Yum soup this good or dumplings anywhere.",Laura G.,"Raleigh, NC",7/1/2015,5.0
"Got a hair in my plate! Disgusting... I had been there once and thought the food was good, went for the second time and I saw a hair in my dish... I pulled it out and then told the waitress, who instead of apologizing or doing something about it, took the plate and then threw it back at me, without saying anything, I had asked them to change it but I could easily see that they only mixed it and cooked it more, which by the way made the chicken hard like a rock... I left my plate untouched and the waitress took it back and did not even offer to remove it from the check. Be aware!!! Not a clean place to eat and they don't even seem to care...",Maria O.,"New York, NY",7/7/2017,2.0
"I came here on a Saturday night with a group of 5 people. This was the only place on the block that had no wait. The cocktails here are reasonably priced and pack a punch. We ordered the pork belly and chinese broccoli entree as an appetizer for all of us to share, and that was the highlight of the meal. The food from then on was really hit or miss. I enjoyed my laksa, but the  pork belly was way too chewy. That pad see iew and pad kee mao were both pretty good, but the pho bo was just OK and panang curry was way too sweet. The wait staff here were friendly and mostly attentive, however my boyfriend ordered a drink, did not receive it, and was charged for it (this was quickly resolved). Overall, I would say that this place deserves its current 3.5 star rating and would suggest ordering a noodle dish and a strong drink.",Lauren S.,"Astoria, New York, NY",1/23/2017,3.0
"Sawadeekrab.

Here's the thing.  It started with Pho, then followed by ramen and then soba.
Well, that's all good in the world of noodles, but the time has come for LAKSA.  Pretty soon, there will be LAKSA houses all over NYC.

The laksa here is very good. Its broth is coconut curry based, very rich and infused with some lemon grass flavors. Due to the curry nature of the broth, some places create an oily mess, but not OBAO. I suspect they use fresh coconut milk. Regardless, the laksa broth here is wonderful. The noodles tho is interesting. Laksa is traditionally served with yellow egg noodles.  Here , I think they use soba noodles. Interesting and it works. The noodles are el dente and does not turn soggy in the soup. Softer and less springy than the yellow noodles, but the smooth texture and slurp-ability makes it work.  The sambal is served on the side and you should stir in the right amount to create the right heat for  you. They also put in roast pork, which is not a traditional ingredient. But it works. I think, they should offer a variety of the Laksa. One should come with fried tofu, boiled egg, shrimp and fish cake.

I sat at the bar and was served promptly by the ever friendly lady behind the bar. She's always smiling, cheerful and happy to be there. I think she's Thai, after all, isn't that the Land of Smiles.  100% sabai sabai.",Luke T.,"Tucker, GA",4/21/2015,4.0
"I met some friends here for a quick lunch on a weekday and this place was full and bustling. We managed to snag the one available table all the way at the back of the restaurant in their patio-converted-to-indoor seating area. That particular corner had really funky seating and we had to literally climb into our chairs while navigating around a tree which could have been a bit annoying, had it been a more relaxed dinner/date kind of situation but since this was just a quick lunch-break meetup with friends, I didn't really mind the awkward seating. The service is QUICK! We had barely sat down and looked at the menus and our waitress was already there to take our order. I got the saute√©d vegetable b√∫n which was one of three vegetarian entree options on their menu. We were each served a salad promptly after our orders were taken (part of their lunch special) and our orders came out in a jiffy.. seriously.. in 5 minutes.. hot..steaming and delicious. The portions are HUGE. I've a healthy appetite and what with the decent sized salad that came with each entre, I was able to make 2 whole meals out my dish. The food tasted and looked great. Besides the yummy food, 'rushed' and 'hurried' best describes my experience here which I guess is expected at lunch hour in mid town Manhattan. I may have had a different experience perhaps if I was here for dinner or during the weekend. I was impressed enough though, to want to come back and check if that proves to be true.",Divya P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",3/7/2017,4.0

The food was great!  I ordered the Khao Soi and was pleasantly surprised with a huge bowl of serious comfort food.  Others ordered Pad Thai shrimp, which arrived beautifully presented and was apparently quite good.  The staff was top notch: available, helpful, neat and quick but not overwhelming.  I can't wait to come back!",Tim R.,"Tarrytown, NY",7/30/2016,5.0
"I came here for dinner last night with a group of friends, for a 6:30PM reservation. Most of us arrived a bit earlier, and were taken to our table towards the back of the restaurant, where there's a lot of space and it was relatively empty. Not for long; before 7, the restaurant was packed, and over the course of the dinner it was easy to see why. My friends shared a variety of appetizers, including the pork belly, spring rolls, golden wings and spare ribs on sugar cane skewers. I didn't try any of these myself because I don't eat meat, but there was clearly a lot of enthusiasm for everything, especially the wings. Admittedly, the sugar cane skewers got the least love. We also got happy hour drinks, because we ordered before 7pm, and everyone got the $2 Sapporo. Someone pointed out that the mugs seemed a little small, but that actually worked really well because the usual 12-16 ounces is more than I prefer with beer anyway.
I had the vegetarian duck basil as my entree, encouraged by the many positive reviews, while almost everyone else had pho (I think one person had pad thai, which looked really good). The vegetarian duck was definitely spicy, even though it initially seemed mild; when you get further down in the bowl to the sauce it really hits. It was tasty, but clearly not duck, despite what I've heard from some other people; I think it might have been seitan, and I personally really like the texture and flavor in its own right. Everyone loved their soup (maybe I can ask for a vegetarian version if I go again). I'd definitely want to check this place out again in warmer weather, because much as I loved the cozy interior with the awesome mood lighting, the patio seating in the very back looks like it would be beautiful to try too.",Alexandra K.,"Philadelphia, PA",3/25/2015,4.0
"First time I had their Pad Thai I got hooked! (had it 4x in 2 weeks!) I had their Pho and thought it was also good but their Bo Luc Lac was so-so I've had it somewhere better.

I'm giving the place 5 stars because of their speed and the staffs are friendly. Also I give them extra props on how they handled the situation when I first ordered for pick up instead of getting the Bo Luc Lac I got two orders of the beef salad. I went back the next day and told them what happened. I would have been OK if they just credited me the $3 difference from the order but instead they comp me an order of Pad Thai!!!

"I went in during weekday lunch and got one of the noodle lunch specials, which was quite good. It came with a salad with too much dressing which was not good.

While I was eating I noticed a lot of the other people at the bar were talking to the bartender about not having enough cash and their purchase being too low for the credit card minimum. Sure enough, I went to pay and their credit card minimum is $15. Most lunch items are $10-$13. I think it's weird and tone deaf that they set such a high minimum, such that the majority of their lunch customers will not be able to pay with credit card.",Andrew K.,"Financial District, Boston, MA",2/23/2016,2.0
"I try not to go to asian fusion places because I tend to feel like the food is never authentic. My friend decided to order take out here for us. They serve thai and vietnamese food.

Of course I'm a harsher critique when it comes to vietnamese food because growing up on authentic vietnamese food every falls under scrutiny.

The pho was truly a mini pint of noodles compared to the average vietnamese restaurant. The taste was ok. The bo luc lac was overcooked and I wouldn't ever get this again. The bun with steak was ok. Overall nothing to rave about.",Sam G.,"New York, NY",1/10/2016,2.0
"After finding out that Hide-Chan still commands long lines, even on a Friday evening, my buddy and I walked around the block and settled down for dinner at Obao. It's got a relatively small eating area and bar upfront, with more seating at the back. It does get surprisingly busy (by the time we left around 8:30 PM, there was a line to get seated), so it's probably a good idea to get a reservation if you're keen on coming here. Service was okay, if not great - the waitress had to come back and ask about my order again, and she managed to swipe my friend's card incorrectly 3(!) times when we were paying at the end. Not a huge deal to me, but definitely a bit sloppy.

As for the food - it's pretty average, if a little overpriced. We split the grilled beef balls, which had really bad texture - very rubbery, with virtually no flavor in them. The sauce they were served with barely helped, as it was a very light, fruity sauce that couldn't mask the blandness of the kebab. The main entree, though, was better. I liked the texture of the crispy pork belly - not as fatty as I've had elsewhere, but with a nice crispy finish, and a solid sauce paired with Chinese broccoli for a hearty meal overall. You get some rice served on the side, which is apparently jasmine but seemed like plain white rice to me. I had a couple of beers on the side; you have a choice between a couple of local crafts and the standard choices, which is pretty straightforward.

In all, I might give it another try, but the food does seem a bit inconsistent, depending on what you're hankering for. The spectrum for the food types is pretty much Thai, Viet, and the fusion between those two - very much southeastern Asian food. For Midtown, it's a solid choice, although there are better options elsewhere in the city.",Asuka N.,"New York, NY",10/28/2013,3.0

The broth is amazing I wish they served it al a carte and the chicken is cooked to perfection.

"I came after happy hour so I missed a lot of the deals. However, they were running a special where you could get a pitcher of beer and a carafe of sake for $19 (I believe, I might be wrong). We ended up doing sake bombs in a quiet manner and no one complained.

We got to sit outside in a backyard area on some picnic table like benches. That was pretty nice. The crowd was a healthy mix of different kinds of people.

The food was decently priced for midtown. However, out of my five friends and I, none of us thought the food was particularly great. I paid $8 for a small bowl of soup and noodles. The chicken in it was pretty dry. A lot of the food was very salty too.

The waiting staff also wasn't the friendliness. We had to keep asking for more water and we got some dirty looks for constantly asking. Sorry, I was thirsty from all the salt :(

Food wise I would give it a 4 and service would be 2, so that explains the 3 stars purely based on mathematics! Would I go back, sure, why not. After a recent trip to Hong Kong I'm craving good Chinese, and this place comes to mind to satisfy the urge.

I like extra spicy, which many places don't make spicy enough.

"Met up with my friend here after work the other day for happy hour and an early dinner. Since she was craving Thai and I *needed* a nice bowl of pho, OBao was the perfect spot. (Even tho the neighborhood isn't really one I find myself hanging out in after work hours since it's about as exciting as a stale saltine...)

Inside, the place is warm and comfortable. Our waiter was lovely and extremely patient with us, as it took us about 15 minutes just to decide what to order. For drinks, since it was happy hour, $2 Sapporos were the way to go.

For dinner, my friend ordered vegetarian spring rolls to start and I had the crispy tofu. Tofu is usually hit or miss for me, but this? This was delicious. For entree, my friend ordered the pork chop fried rice, which she absolutely loved. I had the Pho Bo.

Let's talk about the pho, shall we? I've been told many times that pho is exactly what you need when you are feeling a bit down. And since the previous week had been one of the worst I could remember in a long, long time, I was willing to do anything to lift my spirits a bit. The pho here is simply perfect. The broth was piping hot, allowing the beef and herbs to really settle in nicely. It was full of flavor and really filling for a broth based soup. It seriously took me almost an hour to eat it --  it was SO good, I didn't want it to end.

Long story short...Having a bad day/week/month? Go here with a good friend, order the pho, drink a few beers and chat the night away. You will feel better, trust me.",Lori P.,"New York, NY",2/18/2013,4.0

The inside sitting area is nicely decorated and much quieter than where the kitchen area is. I haven't been to the outside area but it looks nice from what I could see.",Mina C.,"New York, NY",10/6/2013,4.0
"Went here for a lunch with some friends on a weekend afternoon. The salad for the lunch special is just a couple of wimpy leaves with thick dressing globbed onto it. Their pho is subpar - it could use more meat and the broth does not taste rich. My friend had their pork chop and fried rice, which was a nice big serving and actually very tasty. The pork chop was juicy, and the rice had a lot of flavor. The low rating is for their service - got a weird, aggressive vibe from the staff, was pushed the check without asking for it (even tho the place was near empty), and the waitress rolled her eyes at us as we left. A reaaaal bad attitude, man. Hopefully they're not like that to all customers.",Libby C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",3/23/2017,2.0
"Their food is so flavorful everything that we ordered were superb... The price is reasonable and the service is good. The waiter/waitress gives
Suggestion what we will order since me and my husband went here for the first time.

"Came here for a quick lunch on a work day. At 12:05, there were a few tables open--10 minutes later, an enormous line formed. So get here early! The lunch specials were well-priced. I ordered the OBAO special, a chicken leg over coconut rice. It comes with a small bowl of beef soup, but no vegetables except a sprig of cilantro. The food was decent, honestly, but a pretty small portion. I'd come back again if I were really craving Vietnamese while stuck in Midtown East, but otherwise I probably wouldn't return.",Leslie J.,"New York, NY",10/25/2014,3.0
"Popped into OBAO for happy hour/early dinner on Saturday. I was amazed by their happy hour offerings, especially on a Saturday, being $2 Sapporo drafts, $1 special shots (Melon Sake, Kamikaze), and $2 apps! For appetizers we got the beef balls, the pork belly, and the spring rolls; all were on the $2 menu. Overall, the favorite was the pork belly, but nothing disappointed! The beef balls could have used a little something other than or in addition to the duck sauce they came sitting on. The pork belly was perfectly prepared, no complaints there. The spring rolls, though I didn't have one, were referred to as ""what I would expect"", but in total the whole table was happy. The apps came out quickly!

We also started with a round of Sapporos and special shots (the Kamikaze). Both groups came out quickly and nice and cold!

For entr√©e, I ordered their Bao Pho or Pho Bao. The beef was advertised as rare, but came out medium to medium well, but my friends was rare, so it was just mine. Disappointing but didn't kill the dish. I enjoyed the different textures and flavors, added a bit of lime, bean sprouts, and Sriracha and it was incredible! I would have slurped the whole bowl at the end if it were appropriate. Well done!

Where we went from 5 stars to 4 stars, other than the slightly overcooked beef, was the apathetic service. Though all of the food came out quickly, the first set of beers and shots were the only time that we were able to efficiently get drinks, including water. Our waitress was kind and helpful but just wasn't there enough, and we were the only table outside of the bar area. We would have had 2 or 3 more beers each if we had the chance to order.

Overall, would definitely come back, especially during happy hour!",Kevin M.,"Philadelphia, PA",8/2/2015,4.0

"I tried the fresh shrimp rolls and Pho Bo (as it seemed suggested). I do not recommend the shrimp rolls. It tasted stale. I had to use the peanut sauce to finish it. The pho is decent, not the best. The flavour was a bit lacking, and there isn't too much variety of meats. Might get the extra beef balls next time. It's good to stop by for pho if craving for it.",William C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3/12/2017,3.0
"2 of us came here for dinner on a Friday at 6pm with no reservation and was seated promptly. It's an interesting layout as to get to the back seating area you have to walk past the kitchen/the area where the waiters are grabbing the food. I guess it might be cool to look at, but I was too busy whizzing by to really notice.

The menu consists of typical thai and vietnamese food. To start we had the spare ribs on sugar cane and the crispy pork belly. The ribs on sugar cane is a very interesting idea and it was tasty...except for all the chewy fat parts. Maybe I'm just not used to eating it, but that was the only part I didn't like. The non-fatty parts were quite delicious. The crispy pork belly was also delicious. The sauce it was in was great and the fatty parts weren't as chewy as the spare ribs. We devoured the pork belly.

For entrees we both got the grilled pork and shrimp vermacelli noodles. I normally love vermacelli noodles, which is the reason I wanted to come here, but I have to say I didn't love Obao's. Don't get me wrong, they were good, but they didn't quite hit the spot like I thought that would. Perhaps it was the sauce (you know the small bowl of fish sauce and whatever else they put in there that goes with the noodles), but something just wasn't quite right to me.

For dessert we ordered the chocolate lava cake with green tea ice cream. It was ok, but nothing outstanding. The ice cream definitely had a strong green tea flavor.

Overall this is an ok place if you're looking for a place to eat with no wait. You could also probably get in and out very quickly if need be since our waitress was  very prompt. We didn't have to wait for anything and the food came out pretty quickly.",Siri C.,"Frisco, TX",4/4/2015,3.0

The food is decent good.. Bun Bo Hue weekly lunch for me. A little pricey for Vietnamese for the location understandable. Worst experience would be the sugarcane spare rib...

"I have been tried and love ALL the NYC Obao's! There's just something about their Thai food that is just amazing.

This location is near my office so I came here for lunch. There's a lot of seating both indoors and outdoors. The atmosphere seems more casual than the HK one. They have lots of lunch special options and each day, the chef even chooses an appetizer to give everyone for free. The service, food, atmosphere were all great.

The most annoying part is the food was still cold.",Stephen K.,"Kailua, HI",2/21/2017,2.0
Pretty solid Thai food. Big fan of the pad kee mao though it's definitely not authentic. It is very tasty nevertheless. The real gem is actually the khao soi. It's amazing during the winter and extremely rich. The Obao chicken is decent but nothing amazing. Probably the best Thai place in midtown East!,Yuning Z.,"New York, NY",1/2/2017,4.0
"This review is only for delivery. Maybe in-house dining will be better.

It was an ok delivery, didn't take too much time. Their steam dumpling is better than most of the dumpling I have tried from other places, however, I specifically asked not to make the Pad Kee Mao Entr√©e too oily, but it was still very oily.

What disappointed me was the Black Sticky Rice Pudding....not only the sticky rice pudding was quite watery, they put some mousse on top of it, I pretty much throw away the whole thing...it was a big disappointment.",Yi H.,"Seattle, WA",3/29/2013,3.0
What a bad service! I went to this restaurant celebrating our friend birthday Who lives out of town. And i brought a nice fruit edible arrangement cake for her. And in the middle of our dinner. A really rude server come to our table said just to let you know our restaurant dont allow people to bring food from outside or drink if you eat that fruit cake we have to charge you 20 dollar. For goodness sake. If you didn't want us to celebrate a birthday in your restaurant you better PUT A SIGN infront of you restaurant that says DON'T celebrate your birthday here GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! Goodness that server surely chAnge the mood on the table after that. How RUDE was that? You could have just called one of us and tell us nicely! ! ALL 5 of us will NEVER GO BACK to your restaurant and surely we will say to our friends for never going there to celebrate something ever! SO RUDE!,Francesca N.,"Bronxville, NY",6/14/2016,1.0
"I came here with a large group to celebrate my birthday. Pleasing such a large group can be difficult but Obao did it! We started with their sugar cane spare ribs, which is a must try! The Sambal Spiced calamari was also a favorite of the night. For drinks I got the thai sabai, which instantly transported me to a tropical island. The drinks were strong and fairly priced.  For my Entree I had the Pad See Eiw. It was a wonderful combination of spicy and  sweet. They don't have an extensive dessert menu so we didn't get anything sweet. However, they did bring out a cake to sing happy birthday and didn't charge for it. Overall the ambiance was great and the food was delicious. I will definitely be coming here again.",Gabriella G.,"Oceanside, NY",11/22/2016,4.0
"Really good b'un (rice noodles with veggies and a choice of meat). Not so big on pineapple but that's my thing not the fault of the dish. Vietnamese iced coffee wasn't particularly strong and rather milky. Still, great for a week-day pit stop on the way home.",Hannan I.,"Queens, NY",5/25/2016,3.0
"Great lunch place.  Had the Chiang Mai noodle soup.  Noodles were kind of falling apart but the good flavors helped make up for it....sort of.

"I've eaten at OBAO as well as ordered takeaway from them a number of times. First off, they are probably the best south-east Asian cuisine around Midtown East. I've had a craving for good Pho ever since I left California, and good Laksa as well. OBAO makes a decent version of both, and although it's not as authentic as a real south-east Asian place, it's better than the alternatives around.

First off, the pho only comes in one variety -- a few slices of beef and brisket -- which is fine, although it would be nice to have some variety (meatballs, tripe, etc.). The delivery always comes with a small plate of siracha sauce and a box of mung bean sprouts and basil leaves, as is tradition. The pho noodles themselves are well-made and the broth is a bit on the light side, but as I'm trying to watch my sodium intake, that is well-accepted.

In terms of the laksa, I've had friends from Singapore make great laksa before so this review will be biased against OBAO obviously, as I think the soup base is just too bland for my tastes -- I wish it was spicer and more rich. It comes with some noodles in a seperate box in take-out (otherwise its all mixed in together when you dine in).

Service is pretty fast when you're eating at their shop, and the shop itself is bigger than it looks (there is a backroom that is much bigger than the front of the shop where the bar is). It is also relatively quiet, which is nice to have a conversation in. They are also one of the few places I've found that serves Tiger beer which I terribly miss.

Overall a pretty decent experience, great for a regular dinner or lunch spot that is not too expensive. It's nothing special though, and if you have had authentic southeast Asian food before, you'll always find OBAO a bit lacking. However, I feel that for Midtown New York, this is probably as best as it'll get.",Richard Y.,"San Francisco, CA",10/21/2014,3.0
The Bun Bo Hue was very good but almost 90min delivery meant it was not warm when it arrived..So food gets 4 starts but the delivery gets 2. That being said it was great soup for a cold and rainy day when I feel a cold coming on.,S M.,"New York, NY",12/12/2017,3.0
"I love Obao!! I have never dine in there but I always order dinner delivery from them when I have to put in some overtime at work.  I always get the pad see ew or the pad thai and both are very delicious.  I also tried their shrimp claypot with glass noodles and their daikon cake entree.  I love the daikon cake, it reminds me of this chinese dim sum, however the portion is very small as an entree.

My office is pretty far from their location so I am very grateful that they deliver to me.  Their food have very strong flavor, some might think its too sweet or too salty, but i hate bland food so for me obao hits the spot just right!!!",Kerri O.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",7/9/2014,4.0

"I just ordered from them again, and got the steamed dumplings and the Pad See Lew.  O. M. G.  When am I gonna go in here and dine for sit down??

These are some of the best dumplings I have ever eaten!  They're like a piece of shumai mated with a soup dumpling and made this massive, hydrid shumai baby!!!  It was STUFFED to near overflowing with chicken, shrimp, and shiitake mushrooms.  The innards are so plentiful that the dumpling dough is simply wrapped around the innards and steamed to seal it all together!  The chili sauce is ever so lovely, and a PERFECT accoutrement to these lovelies!!!

The Pad See Lew was mango kimchi, braised beef, chinese broccoli, and flat rice noodles tossed in a sauce quite similar to drunken noodle sauce....though mixed perfectly so that there is no superfluous sauce.  It's a bit thicker, so it sticks to the noodles and mixes perfectly.  The beef was a bit too braised for me, borderlining on charred on some pieces....but it worked!!!  SOOOOOOO flavorful!!  Gorgeous!!!  I'm not sure I'm on the mango kimchi tip...since it was more like rehydrated mango...but it worked SOOOOO well in this dish!!!!",Christopher M.,"New York, NY",1/16/2013,4.0
"Don't come here expecting particularly authentic Asian food, but for a very reasonable price, great portions, good ambiance, and pretty convenient location in midtown, you can get a pretty satisfying meal without breaking the bank.

"Obao is really popular in midtown east and it's usually packed with people around lunch time. My coworker and I were able to snag a table which was all the way in the back where the ceiling actually opened up. I've had Obao multiple times before but they were all takeout (quite good if I can possibly add).

Having the sit-down experience this time was a first. I find that they were really short on staff and I only see 2-3 waiters/waitress taking orders. My coworker and I didn't even receive our glasses of water until a group came in later than us did. Not too attentive there. After ordering our food, I asked for the beverage menu. I received the menu but was never asked if I wanted anything from it, not attentive #2.

The food was pretty solid, nothing different than ordering out although I do prefer ordering takeout since I wouldn't have to deal with the unattentiveness of the staff. This is midtown so I expect better waiting manners than just 1-2-3, order/eating/leaving. I would have to think twice before coming back to Obao.",Linh N.,"Brooklyn, NY",6/23/2014,2.0
"I am a big fan of Obao! I moved to the neighborhood a little under a year ago and it is my go-to spot for delicious Thai cuisine.

I normally order from them on Seamless (always good, always relatively fast, and always delicious), but I recently popped in for a to-go order. Though the bar is small, the restaurant is much larger than the view from the street. They also have an outdoor garden which I look forward to dinning in soon.

The staff that waited on me during my recent visit were fantastic. They were patient while I decided and put my order through very quickly. I was having a bad day and a drink at the bar and friendly service can really go along way sometimes.

I look forward to returning and having dinner at the restaurant and I definitely recommend a visit if in the mood for casual delicious Thai, great flavors, good atmosphere, and nice service in the midtown east area.

I ordered the Pad Thai, Green Curry, Thai Basil pasta (not sure of the exact name), and several differet soups in the past. All were very good. The curry was a little spicy - so you should note to have them make it less spicy if needed.",Casey C.,"Manhattan, NY",8/4/2014,4.0

"TIPS:
1) Recommend the stir-fried noodle dishes, grilled pork & shrimp vermicelli, crispy pork and sticky black rice dessert (AMAZING).
2) On weekdays, make sure to come before 6:30 and grab that $16 Sapporo pitcher + sake, or $11 appetizer + entr√©e + soda, OR BOTH!
3) In the winter times, try to grab seats in the back to avoid the draft.

This place is categorized as Vietnamese, Thai, and they also serve some Korean dishes. So it's Asian fusion? Usually when I think of Asian fusion, I think of dishes that, to borrow Ron Swanson's words, half-a$$ing two things rather than whole-a$$ing one thing - never good. But not this place! It surprisingly does Asian fusion very well. I think it's due to the fact that they mingle different Asian cuisines and not add in western influences.

Though I have to deduct one star because there are some misses - I tried Bangkok noodle last time and the chicken pieces were huge and dry; my boyfriend's basil fried rice was a bit moister than what we hoped for. But overall, solid quality.

Delicious food, friendly staff, and proximity to the subways - I'm a fan! Will return, and return, and return in the future",Sunny S.,"Manhattan, NY",11/20/2014,4.0

"Came here for lunch around 1pm during the work week. This place was packed! The couple ahead of us was seated immediately as there was an empty table in the front. The hostess/waitress definitely saw me and my boyfriend waiting for a table, but she failed to acknowledge us. She did however acknowledge a person behind us who wanted to sit at the bar and sent him there. If she had just looked at us directly and told us how long we had to wait, I would be happy with that. But she didn't and it took a few attempts on our part to get her attention.

We were finally led to a small, cramped table in the back room. The table was wet and the menus were clinging to the water on the table. Thanks for wiping down the table but could you take two secs to dry it too? We decided to wipe it down ourselves with napkins. This place is also incredibly noisy, with people very closely seated to each other.

We both got the lunch special. The complimentary appetizer that comes with the special was some tofu with lettuce (not impressive and very dry). I always get the chicken pad kee mao here and as usual, it was delicious.

Unsurprisingly, it took us a while to get glasses of water and to catch the attention of the waiters throughout the meal. All in all, the food is satisfactory here but the service makes your meal a terrible experience. Just get delivery and save yourself the headache.",Melissa C.,"Seattle, WA",8/2/2012,2.0
"It's the hippest vietnamese place I've ever stepped foot in: red chopsticks, turf on the walls, wooden tables, backyard set with an elderly tree. I was a little reluctant to come here initially, since pho in NYC hasn't been able to blow me away. So I got the bun bo hue. Not super authentic, in that there was no pork hoc or cubes of congealed blood, but that didn't really matter to me since it tasted really great and I couldn't tear myself away from it. It's got an aggressively seasoned broth, succulent cubes of roasted/braised pork belly, and thick, al dente noodles. Can't really speak to the pho here, but it seems that it also has a really flavorful broth. I think they use more star anise or something than other places. We got the summer rolls, which seemed to me not so fresh. I'd stay away and leave room for the bun bo hue.",Sarah K.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",4/28/2016,4.0
"This is a strange place because the quality of the food depends on when you order.  

Visit at peak lunch or dinner hours and you'll see literally 30-40 take-out bags on the counter.  That's great for O Bao's bottom line but bad for its customers.  Why?

Because the kitchen just can't produce that much food without severely sacrificing quality.  And it shows time and time again.  

Order or visit at off-peak hours (after 2:30 for lunch, weekend afternoons, before 6:30 or after 9:30 for dinner, etc) and you'll get decent hybrid Asian cuisine (three stars)... Order at peak hours and get bad food (one star).

A few notes: Many of their dishes use overly sickly-sweet sauces so ask for EVERYTHING on the side.  Some solid picks:  Pho bao, golden wings, chicken with coconut rice, ribs and spring rolls.

Service is typical Asian restaurant: Abrupt, uncaring and efficient but not rude.",O U.,"Manhattan, NY",11/17/2014,2.0
"I usually have an OK experience here as the food is pretty good, reasonably priced, and comes super quickly (literally sometimes within 1 minute of ordering which in itself is questionable).

The last time I visited, the customer service was sub-par. It was really hard to catch the server's attention, and when I finally did, he hastily said he'd be right back and never did. Another waiter had serious attitude when I changed my mind about wanting a fork. Toward the end, right after we paid for the meal, he interrupted our conversation and said he needed our table even though we could not have been there for more than half an hour in total.

I understand they had to manage the lunchtime flow, but I do not appreciate being neglected and then rushed.",Khristy N.,"New York, NY",2/3/2017,2.0

You know how you see your first true love and your heart skips a beat and there's butterflies in your tummy? Well, I'm in love with their obao chicken with coconut rice. The chicken is salted to perfection and the meat is tender and juicy like a hot babe walking down the block. Then there's the fluffy soft coconut rice that just gets your breathing in more food than you can consume. Thank god I ordered a side of Chinese broccoli to balance my inner carnivorous animal.

In light of my concerns being responded to by management I am giving them an extra star =),Richard S.,"New York, NY",6/13/2016,4.0
"It has the Michelin star out front.  Yet, you can't always rely on a tire company to guide you in eating.  To be fair, the sign merely indicated: ""Good value.""  

My friend wanted to try Obao and I acceded to her request.  I did tell her that for Thai food, we're probably better off heading to Hell's Kitchen or where else, Queens.  However, she's already visited me the previous day in my nabe, so it was her turn to choose.

We ordered, among others:

~~Crispy pork belly - not crispy and just unremarkable.  I think if they cut it a bit smaller it would be better. Trust me, I'm a pork princess.

~~Spring rolls - In my opinion and comparatively speaking, the best dish of the night and that can't be good.  How can you go wrong with frying spring rolls?

~~Fried whole fish - actually, this is fish fillet.  The fillets were dredged in flour 'til kingdom come and fried.  It was not what I was expecting.  Yes, you'll think I'm weird but I'd rather have the whole fish fried than have fillets of it in chunks of flour.  

We also ordered panang and inquired whether they can use duck instead of beef.  The waitstaff said yes.  When the dish arrived, I was so excited to see how their panang duck measures against other Thai restaurants.  It wasn't duck.  When I inquired, the staff said it was vegetarian duck.  I didn't know if I'd be flattered that I seem like a vegetarian but then, didn't we just order pork belly? And shouldn't they have clarified that the duck they were referring to, does not go: ""Quack, quack""?  

They were nice about it and replaced the fake duck with beef panang.  

It was still an enjoyable evening especially with the $2 Sapporo on draft. And their lunch specials that end at 4 p.m.remains a great deal.   Indeed, when it comes to Thai food, stick to Queens. Or California.",Lara G.,"Astoria, NY",3/19/2012,3.0
My favorite Thai restaurant in NYC. This is a spot that meets my Thai cravings any day. For appetizer I usually order beef on sugar cane and dumplings. Entree : kee Mao and shrimp basil fried rice.

My friend really enjoyed her gai gow pra.  No idea why it wasn't packed with people- it deserves to be,Tracie K.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",1/16/2017,5.0
"I've only ordered online from Seamless here, but gotta say this food is totally solid.

As of now, I've tried the pork belly, shrimp and pineapple fried rice, pad thai, and sticky rice with chicken and sausage side. All of them are really amazing -- very high quality ingredients and extremely well prepared.

Seamless orders do take a while to get to you (45-60 min) which is super annoying and almost not worth the wait. Food however, again is very solid.",Amy G.,"San Francisco, CA",11/3/2012,4.0
The worst Thai food ever! Raw egg in Pad Thai??? Mayo in salad??? I came back 4 or 5 years ago. The food was okay. Now... terrible... I told this to the manager. She argued this is their style of Thai food. Shame on her! We will never come back and we will tell all my friends to stay away from this place.,Dixon C.,"Dublin, CA",1/11/2018,1.0
"Have been to this location twice now.  Overall the food is great - good mix of dishes that will satisfy anyone in your group.  I love their pho!!!

Lunch special includes a small appetizer and is a pretty good deal.  

Lots of space inside - front area is the quietest, back area is very noisy!!!! They also have a small outdoor patio (heated in winter) that looked nice.  I wouldn't mind having a few drinks out there one night.  

Service is quick and friendly.  

Be warned that the lunch rush can be brutal.  Came at 12:00pm today and we got the last table, when we left around 12:45 there was a line already out the door!",Anastasia W.,"San Diego, CA",12/12/2014,4.0
"Love that Obao chicken!
I feel extra special when I order it and they have it.
They only make 20 orders per day.
Catch it if you can!

Standard fresh shrimp rolls and pho.

They have condensed milk ice-cream, which I found very interesting- in a good way.

Service can be hit or miss.
Decor is green, subtle, and relaxing.

Will be back plenty of times.",Onnicha G.,"Woodside, NY",7/6/2012,4.0
"I'll come back just for their spicy basil fried rice with shrimp.  OMG! It's a flavorful and pleasing combination of shrimp, basil, chilli, and bell peppers.  The dish is vibrant, colorful, tasty, and packs zest!  

And you can't beat their early-bird dinner special.  For $10 you get to choose an appetizer, entree, and soda.  We sat in the front section of the restaurant (by the bar), which isn't much to gush over (not really a fan of the grass-covered walls, but that's just me).  

But then I walked to the back section and all was forgiven.  Somewhat, there's still grass on the walls.  In any case, the back has a really nice ambiance, and I'll definitely choose to be seated there next time.  I'm loving the outdoor patio too.

Well, I'll try my best to explore the menu next time and select something else besides my beloved basil fried rice...pinky swear.",J M.,"Brooklyn, NY",4/26/2012,4.0
Fantastic spot! The pho was so good! Super authentic and some of the best I've had. Had the sugar cane beef skewers too and they were so innovative and delicious I couldn't stop eating then. The papaya salad as well was a huge hit! Can't wait to go back again! Large menu and great prices!,Hailey M.,"Holly Springs, NC",5/28/2014,5.0

"Just moved in the neighborhood, and this will definitely be my go-to spot for a nice hot bowl of Pho on a cold winter night. They have lunch specials which is $1 off every item. Not bad seeing their Pho is originally priced at $9. Also had the best edamame of my life there. Not sure if it's actually on the menu. The chef was nice enough to send some over to my sister and me while we waited for our food. Staff is friendly and attentive. Other dishes are solid as well. I recommend the Chiang Mai Noodles, Pad Thai, and the BBQ meat on a sugarcane skewer. Mmm",Emily M.,"Manhattan, NY",10/5/2014,5.0

"Do not order for delivery. I called to have my order delivered ASAP. The girl said yes. I waited 45mins later and called back to check and the girl on the phone says ""you want your order to be delivered at 4pm right?"".

Did not get to eat until two hours later. Very horrible bad experience.",Cheny N.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",8/17/2014,2.0
"Vietnamese food is severely lacking in representation in the Midtown East area, wich makes OBao a welcomed addition to this food truck and cafe-saturated neighborhood. A small eatery that is merely a bit larger than Little Thai Kitchen across the street, the bright, open kitchen, dim lighting, and handful of tables add a chicness factor to OBao. Surprisingly but conveniently, it is never too crowded even during peak lunch hours. Ordering take-out is a very popular option for lunch seekers.

The Bun Bo Hue and Pho Bo are fair portions in comparison to Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown. Soup, noodles, and bean sprouts all come in separate containers to preserve the texture of the noodles. The Bun Bo Hue wasn't too spicy, but it hits the spot. The Pho Bo didn't offer any tendon, but there is plenty of beef at the bottom of the soup. The soup was a bit on the oily side, but was very flavorful. Both noodle soups were $9, which is not surprising for Midtown pricing. The grilled pork and shrimp over vermicelli ($10) had wonderful flavors, but the vermicelli is served colder compared to the same order in other Vietnamese

I am very curious to try the Singapore Laksa and Chiang Mai Noodles the next time. In the end, Michael ""Bao"" Huynh has come up with an excellent new addition to his existing empire, and it is perfectly situated on the same block along side solid lunch spots like Little Thai Kitchen and Mantao Sandwiches.",Nelson W.,"New York, NY",12/3/2009,3.0
"Nice Place, Food is ok. Service is very good.
Got the chops, lots of them on the plate, tasted little bit sweet that's why I gave it 3 stars, but definitely worth trying.

Enjoy!!",Emad B.,"Staten Island, NY",12/29/2015,3.0
"Ordered takeout for delivery for the first time.  Had heard about this place and known about its other locations. Although the estimated delivery time said 60-75 minutes the food came in 1/2 hour.  Had the thin grilled pork chops with an add-on spring rolls and everything was delicious.  Best of all, I got their 20% discount by ordering on Seamless.  Good deal, good meal and now I need a nap!",Wailana W.,"New York, NY",7/25/2014,4.0
"5 stars!!! This place should be renamed ""O-Bomb!""

Me and my friends  and co-wokers order and come to eat all the time, convenient location by work.  Let's just say you cant go wrong with anything on the menu....

PAd See Iew is amazing...the noodles and beef cooked perfectly.

Bangkok Chicken...wow! best piece of chicken (except for NoMad hotel for $90).

Shrimp Prik King....SO GOOD, if you can handle that spice.

Pretty much this place is the sh*t.  I wish i could eat every day....so many options, and they all prove to be 5 star worthy.

If you are in the area....head on over to Obao and enjoy pretty much anything they serve you...

and finish with condensed milk ice cream and fried banans (or just order every desert on the menu like we do)

ENJOY!!!!!!",Matt G.,"New York, NY",2/6/2014,5.0
"Ok, so this place happened to be downstairs from where we're staying, and I wish I knew about it earlier. The food was so good I wanted to punch a midget. It was the first time I had Pad Tai, and holy shitsnacks I was impressed. And their Vietnamese coffee is fantastic.
Try it. Then bring a friend.",Alex I.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5/24/2015,4.0
"So delicious!  The menu is robust with diversified options.  In my first visit, we tried the salt & pepper shrimp and pork belly appitizers.  Both were incredible!  The pho was also notable, with toppings and the meat was tasty.  For an entree, the server suggested the fish special, which was amazing and MP was fair at $25.  The other entree we got was the short ribs.  It wasn't bad, but it was my least favorite.

I highly recommend Obao!  This was a great find!",Shawna B.,"New York, NY",3/4/2015,5.0
"Caught up with some friends over dinner and it wasn't until I stepped foot in here that I realized that I've been here before. The food was fairly decent and the ambiance seemed good for a small group to meet up after work.

"Very efficient and nice environment for dinning.
I was looking for fast but good food in a rush in one afternoon. I ran into this place during my work and asked them to be asap since I needed to rush.
Waitress was polite, efficient and served me with appropriate care, which made me super happy and satisfied.
The food taste are OK, what impressed me were the very fresh shrimp and other food materials. It's not common to see food with that quality in such kind of restaurant.
I had no time to express my satisfaction on that day. since from gertting in to that restaurant to going out immediately after check paid, I spend only 15min there. S I decided to give them a review here.
I will come again to enjoy the quiet and cafe type environment.",Alice W.,"Jersey City, NJ",2/4/2015,5.0
The back patio area is super cute and good for like a first date. It's not a Korean place but their Korean beef plate is surprisingly good.

"This used to be my go-to restaurant. The food was delicious and it kept me coming back.

Somewhere down the line (probably about 8 months ago), the quality of food noticeably decreased.  I used to bring crowds of people here, but I stopped recommending the restaurant now and occasionally order the Pho.

LOVE OBAO!!!",Daph D.,"New York, NY",1/5/2014,5.0
"In the last 3 weeks, I have gone to Obao 3 times. Twice to sit in, and once for takeout (today). It struck me that I haven't yet written a review, so as I finish up my bo bun hue here at my desk, I'm going to write a quick note.

The first time I went, I was craving pho in a very bad way. I did a simple search for places near my office where I could acquire pho and decided to go to Obao without even knowing that their pho was Michelin recommended. Now I know why. It was excellent! The staff there are friendly, service is fast, and everything comes out hot, fresh, and delicious.

On my second trip, I decided to try the bo bun hue instead of the pho and now I've found a new favorite thing. Now that I know I can order for pickup to bring back to my desk and enjoy at my leisure, I will probably be ordering even more frequently. This has absolutely become a new staple for me.",Stephanie R.,"Brooklyn, NY",2/27/2015,5.0
"It's so hard to find good pho outside of Chinatown! And I hear even the pho in Chinatown is nothing compared to what you can find out in San Jose, CA. But I digress :)

I was really craving a hot bowl of pho the morning after a long night out. While Hell's Kitchen is known for its abundance of Thai restaurants (Wondee Siam I, II, III anyone?), the area sorely lacks a restaurant that can serve up a good bowl of Vietnamese pho. After some searching on Yelp, we came across OBAO, a Michelin-recommended restaurant.

They have an awesome lunch special deal, valid even on the weekends. From 11:30AM - 4PM, you get a free starter with entree. The price for the pho was a dollar cheaper than dinner prices. The chef chooses the starter, and on that Sunday we got a small bowl of cold saut√©ed noodles. To be honest, while the dish was tasty, we did feel like we were served leftover noodles from the night before. Can't really complain about free food but it did affect our perception of the restaurant.

We ordered two bowls of the Pho Bo and Grilled Pork & Shrimp Vermicelli. I was sad that they didn't serve Pho Dac Biet, which includes cuts of tendon and tripe. The pho broth was good but lacked the depth of broth I've had at other Vietnamese restaurants. The noodles were cooked to the proper ""al dente"" levels, so props there! The Pho Bo comes with a lot of noodles and I happily ate the leftovers for breakfast the next day.

Grilled Pork & Shrimp Vermicelli was good, but they under cooked the pork the first time and had to send out a new dish. I really enjoyed the marinade used on the tender pork slices.

Overall this restaurant satisfied my craving for pho, but I might just go to Pho 32 or Chinatown next time I have the craving.",Ling L.,"New York, NY",2/24/2014,3.0
"Never actually tasted the food. Were told to sit anywhere. Waited 15 minutes. No menu. No water. Another couple walks in, and they get their menus. Maybe think about training your front of house.

EDIT:

Chan, mistakes are understandable, but as you well know there are a million restaurants in this city, and at the vast majority of the ones I've been to, at least one staff member comes to us to ask if we've been helped. We were sitting at an empty table for our entire time there, and several staff passed by without a word. If you can't even handle that basic level of standard service, I'd rather not waste my time trying to flag someone down and just go somewhere else.",Al M.,"Manhattan, NY",8/13/2015,1.0
"Huge fan of this place and I find myself craving it pretty often!

The pho bo is perfect to warm you up during the winter time. I absolutely love their spring rolls which are a crispy perfection. Dipped in their fish sauce, these spring rolls are by far my favorite over all the authentic Vietnamese restaurants I've been to.

If you go during lunch time, they usually give you a free appetizer to sample. Each time it's different and they have always been pleasant suprises.

My favorite dish is the Chiang Mai noodles. The curry-like broth has amazing flavor but it is on the spicy side.

I've also tried the pad thai, pad see ew and bbq pork chop with fried rice which all taste very authentic and delicious.

The happy hour dinner special is an awesome deal that ends at 6:30pm. It includes an appetizer, entree and soda.

Lastly the thai iced tea is always great- not too sweet, not too bitter. It's the perfect compliment to each meal.",Joanie H.,"Flushing, NY",9/5/2014,5.0
"We yelped this spot for pho but I ended up craving pad thai. My friend got the Thai fried rice and we got spring rolls as appetizers. All the flavours were really good, in particular the BBQ pork on my friend's fried rice. My pad thai was a little sweeter than I like, but otherwise good. I do however retreat the decision to not get pho, as it looked really good when it arrived for other tables.

We were seated quickly at noon on a Sunday, and I enjoyed the quiet atmosphere. My one complaint was that the staff seemed to get overwhelmed a little even on an otherwise steady (but not super packed) weekend rush, which makes me wonder about the level of service on a weekday.

Ultimately I found this spot capable and satisfying, although perhaps not stand-out. I'd recommend it for a safe lunch or dinner spot if you're in the area craving Thai or Vietnamese comfort food.",Jennifer F.,"Irvine, CA",11/16/2014,3.0
"I can't believe that I've walked by Obao so many times without going in to sample the fare.  My colleague and I decided to stop in for lunch this week since we work nearby.

After our complimentary meatball we started with steamed dumplings and spring rolls. Both were delicious and so fresh. I especially liked the spring rolls which I wrapped in lettuce and mint leaves. So fresh!

For our next course my colleague had shrimp pad thai and I had pho ba w/ beef balls. I didn't have much to say during lunch because I was so in love with my pho ba. It was tasty!  When my colleague received his pad thai he was so excited that it included a runny fried egg. So he was busy eating as well.

Such a perfect lunch for a super frigid day!",Saba J.,"Washington Heights, Manhattan, NY",1/10/2015,4.0

"Pad Thai and pad see ew were both perfect, the pad Thai was almost creamy due to the egg that they put on top. I asked for spicy and got spicy! Yay! Oftentimes when I ask for spicy I still get something very mild, but that wasn't a problem here.

I was nicely surprised when it came to desert because I discovered they have deserts from spot desert bar on the menu! Love the black Forrest cake, it's my absolute favorite way to end a nice meal.

Overall a very cute and delicious place.",Sumyia H.,"Bedford Park, Bronx, NY",2/12/2016,4.0
"I have to resort to eating here all the time and unfortunately, it's not very consistent and the food more times than not is very salty.  I love that they throw in a poached egg in the pad thai, but it is otherwise pretty flavorless.  The soups especially the Singapore Laksa is great, but all the dishes are pretty overpriced (Pho is $10???).  The shrimp is always tasteless and the grilled meats are good but very fatty and again, too salty.  If the prices are going to be this high, they really should increase the portions.  Also, the fried spring rolls are so greasy, I will never order them again.

I've had the porkchop and the pad see ewe but it's all about the same in that they are flavorful but overly salty, overpriced and in the end will leave you somewhat dissatisfied.",Grace S.,"Z√ºrich, Switzerland",11/20/2013,2.0
"It's not impressive, but it's not bad either. We got the porkchop and rice. It was in a bowl, so it was hard to slice the porkchop up. And it was only one porkchop on the bone with lots of rice and very little veggies. This Vietnamese dish usually has tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce. The beef salad, was good, but i didn't like the veggies that was in it. The carrots were chunky. Usually, this would medium rare slices of beef with the fish sauce/lime juice with cilantro and crushed peanuts. I just thought the chunky carrots were a little weird. But the place is okay.",Julie S.,"Manhattan, NY",4/7/2016,2.0
"I have to say,  customer service was sucky, but the PHO, oh that PHO and the dumplings!! Awesomeness!!!. We came here early on November 20th, it was 3:30 pm, we decided to try the place because of the reviews. We got seated immediately, nobody was there.  15 mins later they finally take our order.  Food came out rather quickly.  This has been out of the best PHO I had, and I am a PHO junkie.   The broth was so perfectly tasty,  I would have eaten it without my sriracha or the hoisin sauce.  When we were about to leave we had to wait for 30 mins to get  somebody to bring us our check because we never had a waiter/ess.   Overall, I do recommend this place.   Cant' wait for my next visit to NY so I can eat here again.",Brandy P.,"Alexandria, VA",11/27/2015,4.0
"Not the best pho in the city, but definitely does the job after a night of drinking. Delivery is pretty quick and reliable too. I've only ordered the pho here and nothing else so can't speak to the rest of the menu. But I always get weirded out by asian restaurants that serve thai, viet, chinese, and japanese....why not focus on just ONE and do a great job!",Grace C.,"Los Angeles, CA",9/3/2015,3.0
"I'd give this place a 3.5 rather than a 3. Overall, a good experience.

I recently moved from VA/DC area, which has phenomenal Vietnamese cuisine so I'm a bit particular when it comes to eating Vietnamese dishes. I'm not a picky eater and can almost eat anything. But something with Vietnamese food... you have just got to get it right.

But, I also realize there is a shortage in amazing Pho places, so I don't complain as much as long as it has the right spices and enough meat, then that'll be OK in my book.

I came here for lunch on a weekday as I was craving a bowl of Pho after a long weekend. I came in around 12:45 and I was seated right away. I didn't want a long lunch so I ordered right away and asked for my check right then too. I ordered the Pho Bo, and it came out about 10 minutes later. Overall, it was OK. They did give just the right amount of beef and noodles. The flavor of the soup was pretty good, but could taste and feel the MSG in it, so not completely authentic.

The atmosphere was very cute, with wood and bench seating. I looked around me and majority of people were eating Pho, but they also had other Vietnamese and Thai dishes. I'd come back here to try their other entrees and if I'm craving, I'll come back here for a bowl of Pho during my lunch break at work.",Bella N.,"New York, NY",8/26/2015,3.0
"I came with a group of friends and didn't order much so take this review with a grain of salt.

I just ordered the summer roll with shrimp and a peanut sauce. The sauce was delicious. However I've definitely had better rolls. The wrapping was thick and chewy. The roll had way to much cilantro. Almost 70% of it was cilantro instead of actual shrimp. I had to pick at it to get anything substantial that wasn't wrap or cilantro.

I would want to try some other dishes to get a holistic picture but just don't get the summer rolls.",Alice Z.,"Brookfield, WI",8/25/2014,3.0

I opened the container to the dish to be 90% pork which was tough & mostly pieces of hard fat.  The shrimp looked like they were peeled by a dog & were not cleaned.  Both the pork & the shrimp were not fresh.  The beansprouts smelled funky.",Jennie A.,"Brooklyn, NY",6/3/2013,1.0
"Obao? More like OWow-There's actually a place in midtown that serves half decent vietnamese food? Whowuddathunk. Nothing Vietnamese here is quite super authentic, and in particular I thought the ""caramelized fish in clay pot"" sucked and the lack of caramelization makes me suspect it wasn't cooked in a clay pot either. Vietnamese grandmas universally would weep in shame if they tried it. On the other hand, the vermicelli dishes are quite delicious and I've had a lot worse Vietnamese noodle soups in the city. The Thai dishes in general aren't bad either, and I especially like the chicken leg over coconut rice (more like saffron rice?).

Delivery can really suck in terms of wait time, but if you're going into the place then they have a fantastic happy hour with $2 sapporo draughts.",Monte H.,"Cupertino, CA",3/10/2014,3.0
"Great, friendly service ups already reliable, good, asian fusion.

as others have said, the pho is good. I've had better but sometimes you don't want to travel downtown - or to Dallas (best Pho I've had in six states).

"OBao was also at the LuckyRice Night Market event a while back, but honestly I couldn't remember what I had or how I felt. I passed by it though a few weeks ago and felt curious to try it. I ordered the ribs with sugar cane and the pho, and my friend ordered a plate of mixed vegetables. We also got cocktails, hers was Saigon-something and mine was Mekong-something. The cocktails were fine, I preferred hers over mine. I'd like to try some of the others though especially if I came for happy hour.

The sauce in the vegetables dish tasted good. The pho was quite delicious, I would say that it's one of the better ones I've had. It's not the cheapest and best pho in New York though. I really liked the meat being at the line between cooked and raw. My favorite thing of the night was the ribs. I loved the meat's texture and flavor, and the sugar cane's sweetness was subtle and had a fun crunchy bite.",James K.,"El Cerrito, CA",6/23/2011,4.0

I got the BBQ Pork Chop with Thai Fried Rice and it was soooooo good! The serving was also quite generous that I had to take home my meal after eating half of it. I also got the Thai Iced Tea and it was also good.

The staff were really nice also. We sat by the window and it felt really cozy where we were sitting. There are bar seats also available inside.

I will definitely go back to try some more!!!",Daphne C.,"Manhattan, NY",3/3/2015,5.0
"Came here for the specials after passing by a day earlier. You can't beat the $2 delicious draft Sapporos and $2 appetizers. Although you are limited with choices, their happy hour (sun-wed all night) and 212 special (thurs-sat 4-7pm) are all you need for a great quick outing for food and drinks. Their prices overall are decent and the food is good and well worth your money. The service is punctual but the people aren't very personable.

Overall, it's a really nice, small spot with a great atmosphere. It's casual but cozy and definitely a place to go any night of the week.",Samantha D.,"Long Island, NY",1/19/2012,5.0
"Came here for dinner this time.

The $5 cocktails (at least on Wednesdays) were so-so. The Red Sky tasted like cough syrup, and the Ocean Breeze (or Ocean-something) was not too sweet but a little strange.

The veggie spring rolls were ok, a little mushy. The beef salad was plentiful and spicy. Lastly, the chili-salt shrimp were good, but if you don't like shells on your shrimp, this dish is not for you.

Service was a little slow, but I think there just aren't enough people working there at this hour.",Jess L.,"Sacramento, CA",4/27/2011,3.0
"I would recommend this place for select items. There's a lot of room for improvement.

We started with the calamari which I would have given 5 stars for except it was so salty that had I not shared it with 5 other people, I would have sent it back.

A friend and I ordered the Pho after that which is supposed to be Michelin recommended....I'm still scratching my head as to why that is. It was not very flavorful and the beef was so so. Subsequently, we asked for Sri racha and this other smokey red chili mix in order to rectify the tasteless Pho.

The big hit at our table was the Chiang Mai noodle soup bowl. Definitely recommend this one. A friend had the Pad Thai and it was decent. Another friend ordered the Singapore noodles and it was flavorful but super dry! The last friend ordered the tamarind fish and it was tasty but also good dry. Everything just missed the mark slightly with the exception of the Chiang Mai noodles.

We finished with the molten chocolate cake with green tea ice cream...delicious.

In terms of table service, it annoyed me and my friends that they didn't bring out all the dishes at the same time. Seriously need to avoid doing this in the future...not a mark of a good restaurant in my opinion.",Shruti R.,"Manhattan, NY",2/12/2014,3.0
"Enjoyed a nice meal here with my boyfriend when we happened onto this place by accident.

I had the pad see iew and the bf had one with sesame oil and eggs. It was very good and well seasoned. I also got a thai iced tea which was really good. Nice size for a good price. The waitstaff was nice. Attentive, but not overbearing. I'd come back if I was around the neighborhood again!",Melissa N.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/5/2011,4.0
"This review is based only on the Bun Bo Hue. While excited by the prospect of seeing this classic Vietnamese noodle soup on the menu, I was equally disappointed once it came to the table. Beyond the proper rice noodle (which was a meager portion), the soup I was given bore no resemblance to the Vietnamese classic. The pork belly (a substitute for pork leg or knuckle) was rock hard and dry. There was no taste of lemongrass or chili spice. Maybe the Thai chefs in the kitchen should try the real thing before they further disparage this dish--as it is a shame if this mediocre rendition is what innocent patrons think Bun Bo Hue should taste like.",S T.,"Brooklyn, NY",7/31/2016,2.0
"Pros:
- Predictable
- Super fast service
- Nice decor & ambiance

Cons:
- SALTY
- Few seats
- Servers are not really able to communicate what certain items on the menu mean",Mary W.,"New York, NY",7/28/2013,3.0
"I've been here twice.

Once for a casual lunch, and another for a friend's birthday.

The casual lunch was a good experience. I ordered their chicken with coconut rice and it was good. The rice was nicely cooked and coconuty. The chicken was unmemorable, but not bad. Out of all 3 of us that was there, the chicken was the most memorable.

I also came here because they have Durian shake. It was good! I was craving a durian shake, and the shake was smelly and delicious.

One of my codiners ordered their ""Michelin recommended"" pho. It was no where NEAR Michelin recommended. The broth was lukewarm and uninteresting. The mix-ins (brisket, tripe, and beef balls) were few and mundane. (There were like 2 of each item) The noodles were standard. I really don't think the Pho deserved ""Michelin"" anything.

I came back here for birthday party nearly a year later.

They had $2 sapporos on draft. That's a pretty great deal.

I had the pork belly with chinese broccoli this time, and it was good. The pork they used was DEFINITELY NOT pork belly though. It was too lean of a cut. The sauce was good. No complaints there.

The same codiner ordered the Pho again, and again, she was disappointed.

Everyone else in my party just seemed to not love their food either. We ordered the coconut chicken for the table, because one of my friends heard that this is their famous dish and they only make a certain amount a day. Well, it was 7:30 p.m. and we were still able to order it.

The service was good, everyone seemed really busy, but they came around to check on us every so often. As someone who was a server, large groups are kinda scary. So, kudos to them for tending to us!",Lisa Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/26/2013,2.0
"Definitely one of my new favorite Thai places EVER (and definitely my favorite in the city). Everything here tastes fresh and flavorful. Everything excites me. My favorites are: drunken noodles, basil tofu, pad thai. Could eat these dishes from OBAO forever. Have heard some not so great things about the service here but I have not experienced anything myself (so cannot comment). However, the food quality is definitely amazing so I'd give it a try so you can see for yourself!",Roopa S.,"Manhattan, NY",6/4/2015,5.0
"My friend introduce me to this place and they have great selection of food. The menu looks well design and the foods there are tasty. I recommend trying the pad thai over there, it doesn't feel heavy. Another personal favorite of mines is the obao chicken. The chicken was pretty moist when you take a bite into it. The chilly sauce complements the chicken and the rice together. It gives you a sense of interesting flavors.",Sumen T.,"New York, NY",10/17/2015,4.0
"The food here is great. They are accommodating with larger parties and splitting checks which is really nice. Food is amazing and tastes really authentic. Note when an item is marked spicy, it's really spicy. The food can be really hot but overall is great. Some of the better asian food I've had in a while. Will go back in the future.",Rachel B.,"Scarsdale, NY",7/23/2017,4.0
"Pretty good food.  The pho was a-okay...certainly not good pho.
My chicken with chili sort of soy sauce was very good.
Nice atmosphere, decent prices.  Too many in the area and not special enough to go back to but glad we tried.",Alexandra C.,"New York, NY",11/9/2011,3.0
"This place has really gone downhill over the last year or so.  And that is really a shame as there isn't really a good Vietnamese place in midtown east.

We ordered the pho bo and the Singapore noodles today.  The beef in the pho was rubbery and the shrimp in the Singapore noodle had gone bad.  Overall, I don't think the food they are serving here is very fresh and coming back here means running the risk of getting food poisoning.

With service being slow to anemic, there is really no redeeming quality for this place any more.",Stephen J.,"Manhattan, NY",6/30/2013,1.0
"Went for dinner and got the recommended items on the menu--everything tasted amazing. Drink menu is satisfying, and the atmosphere is perfect. I am now obsessed with this place, and definitely coming back!",Amber C.,"New York, NY",3/13/2016,5.0
"Had the chicken pad Thai for lunch. Thought it was very good, for the price, however, there should have been a little more. With tax it was 13 bucks and change. Saddened to see no lunch specials. There are plenty of Thai places in the city that are just as good that offer you a 9 or 10 dollar lunch special AND !!! you get a choice of an appetizer. They should offer the same lunch special as their other restaurant in Hell's Kitchen. (9 bucks) The one in hells is much nicer too.",Brian V.,"Staten Island, NY",2/15/2016,3.0
"Wow. We had family in town so we were a group of 8 for dinner. It was a great experience all the way around. The service was efficient and friendly; the menu was varied enough for every to find something they liked (we particularly liked the eggplant/tofu and duck noodles); the cocktails were interesting. And, the price was fantastic. Very affordable.

We'll be back",Christina W.,"Sarasota, FL",4/11/2016,5.0

"It's really good and the service is great but it's not fast at all, and there's usually a wait time. Try the items that are marked by a Michelin recommended logo. I really liked cane sugar sticks wrapped in pork belly strips. (appetizer)",Natalia H.,"Brooklyn, NY",6/4/2015,4.0
"Me and a friend decided to take a chance on this place since we were too hungry and  it was too cold outside to search for another noodle spot for dinner. Oh boy, I wish we weren't so lazy. We came and asked for a table. It was Friday evening , so we knew what we are getting ourselves into, yet there was no communication from the staff about -if they have a table or they are booked. We just stood there while hostess and another staff member were staring at the reservation screen and speaking in the different language. Nothing  like - ""oh let us look, or give us few minutes"". After some time of silent awkward wait, it was announced that we have a table. Well, thanks , I guess.
Once we got to our table, we promptly ordered-spring rolls, pad thai and Singapore Laksa. Pretty safe and standard fare. It seemed like every server had their own section. Our server was a nice young lady who took the order and our food got to us on time.
Once food came, my Laksa was absolutely disgusting and I mean disgusting. Buckwheat (which I love) noodles were mushy and bland, while broth was overwhelmingly greasy and shrimps in it had strong funky aftertaste.
Our server was no where to be found and other servers were literally avoiding any eye contact with us, so I patiently waited for my server to order something else. 2, 3, 4,5, 10 minutes- she is no where to be found, my friend is already done with half of her food. Finally , our young lady shows up, when I loose my appetite from frustration. I paid for the full plate of Laksa which I had two sips from and left at the restaurant.

Such a shame since, I really liked their 9th avenue location. I mean ,I really don't have to ask for the manager to comp my untouched greasy food.",Eve A.,"West Islip, NY",4/25/2015,2.0
Order from here all the time delish. This is the only place that can do delivery pho right!,K M.,"Manhattan, NY",2/26/2017,5.0
It's ok. Papaya salad was a disappointment. Pad Thai required extra effort to swallow. Pad see ew went chowing down quite fast.,WenZhen N.,"Manhattan, NY",5/18/2016,3.0
Went here today and I have to say super disappointing. The decor is beautiful and the atmosphere could be intimate if you didn't have the servers hovering above and around you rushing you to place your order 5 mins after sitting down. I didn't even have enough time to look at the menu and was pushed into placing an order resulting in a plate i disliked. Glass noodles are not my forte! furthermore the food comes out in about the same time food in McDonald's takes to prepare. Literally it took all of 5 minutes for our food to come out which is strange to say the least. The whole thing was a rushed experience and the food was mediocre. My chicken had the fattiest nastiest skin on it  and I've been nursing a stomach ache ever since. There are plenty of better Thai restaurants in NY .,Sarah A.,"Kew Gardens, NY",4/3/2015,2.0
"Really nice little restaurant with some cool green hanging walls!
A must try is the spare ribs on sugar cane - very interesting!

I am dinging 1 star for the service, whilst polite, the waitress did not really check on us throughout the meal or ask if we wanted more drinks (would have certainly ordered more)!",Vishal C.,"Manhattan, NY",6/2/2014,4.0
"Obao is without a doubt one of my favorite restaurants. The atmosphere is relax yet elegant, without being too pretentious. The food is scrumptious. The fusion between the different Asian cuisines is well executed and inventive. I couldn't recommend this resturant enough. It's tucked in a Hell's Kitchen row, just easy enough to miss so keep your eyes open.",Jonas S.,"Brooklyn, NY",10/20/2015,5.0
"Obao is legit.  For appetizers, we generally order the spare ribs on sugar cane skewers, which are absolutely delicious.  The meat is thinly sliced and wrapped around the skewers, and is covered in a sweet sauce and crushed peanuts.  (I still can't figure out if I'm supposed to eat the skewers, though I've been known to eat - and love - sunflower seed shells, so this should probably inform my take of the situation).  The pork belly appetizer is also incredible, though sometimes a bit much right before the main course, but only because they give you such a generous portion.

The pad thai here is some of the best I've ever had.  It always comes out fresh and hot (not gross and with clumps of noodles stuck together like some places), and is topped with a delicious poached egg - I love that they do that; the runny yoke mixed in with the rest of the dish is such a creative, yummy way to enjoy pad thai.  The pho here is pretty solid too from what I've heard from my dining partners, but I myself have never tried it.  I mixed things up today and got the green curry with chicken, which was good, though not a standout like the pad thai.

I like that Obao also brings out little house appetizers before each meal - usually something like edamame or some sort of salad.  They also have great presentation for the dishes.  Service is generally very good - everyone here is friendly, but sometimes they get a little off their game during the week...though it is lunchtime in Midtown I'm talking about, so you're not going to get the same service you would during off hours.  It's mostly just basic stuff like multiple servers coming to take your order or mixing up drink orders - no biggie though, they're really chill about it and happily set things to rights.

Also take note of the astroturf-covered walls in the front room - interesting decorating choice, but it works!",Kaitlin W.,"Brooklyn, NY",3/13/2014,4.0
"We were looking for a place to go for my friends birthday last weekend and after searching yelp, we were between Rain Thai and oBao. After reading through the reviews, we decided to go to oBao - so thanks fellow yelpers! You helped us to make a great decision :) The size of the place - from the outside - is deceiving; it looks a lot smaller than it actually is. They actually have a bunch of additional seating in back.

I had the green curry and substituted tofu for the beef and it was delicious! A bit spicy but no so spicy that I couldn't eat it without having to chug water after each bite. The service was great, the chopsticks were cool - they were red and a sturdy plastic - and on a Saturday night at around 8pm, it was pretty empty. There were a group of 5 of us and we got sat immediately.

In conclusion, if you're looking for yummy Thai food, you won't go wrong by choosing this place.",Tracie B.,"Pompton Lakes, NJ",2/27/2013,4.0

"UPDATE: not sure what has happened to this place but their quality has definitely gone down hill. I could have continued to deal with their poor service but the past few times between delivery and dining their food has been horrible.

Previous Review:
Finally a place in midtown that truly captures the perfect fusion of Thai and Vietnamese food. The atmosphere is nice whether you sit in the back or the front and when the weather is warmer they have a really cute back garden area. Despite the poor service you really can't beat the price for the area it's in and the food is amazing so it's hard not to keep going back. They also deliver and the turn-around time is pretty quick.

"Pho had a strange smell but was okay overall. The portions for the pho was a good size and very filling. I got the dumplings appetizer; they only gave my friend and I 2 tiny ones and it was $4; not worth even though they were good.

I liked the fake grass wall.

The bathroom was clean and its lights were very cool!!",Yuan Y.,"New York, NY",1/9/2016,3.0
"I got pork chops and a really good tom yum soup for lunch. Their tom yum soup is the best I've tasted so far. Their Thai tea is also good-- not too sweet. I love the ambiance of this restaurant.

What more can you ask for?",Katherine D.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",8/18/2013,4.0
Came here because our original place was packed and our bellies were crying. Little expectation. Surprisingly tasty. Chang mai noodles full of  spice and heat. PInapple fried rice true mix of sweet and salt.,Bon W.,"Manhattan, NY",11/27/2013,3.0
"I used to come to OBAO at least once a week when I lived a few blocks away, but now that it's a little further away from my place, I seamless this place quite often. I always order the Pad Sew Ew, Pad Thai, Thai Basil Fried Rice, Daikon Shrimp dish, vegetarian spring rolls, summer rolls, and/or thai iced tea. I will sadly admit I noticed the dishes are not as good as it used to be (like compared to circa 2013)...not sure what happened there, but nonetheless, still does its job.

Some things they need to improve on is their delivery time - I used to not have that much of a problem with their timing, but for the past year or so, they take at least an hour for the food to arrive, which I think it's unacceptable considering I only live 10 blocks away from the restaurant. I know they have a lot of volume, but if they want their customers to continue ordering delivery, they should hire more delivery guys during their dinner rush hour. There were many times I picked another restaurant to order from because I wanted my food to come in 20 minutes, not an hour and 20 minutes. Also, I really don't like how they have to charge me an extra $1 for peanut sauce in a tiny soy sauce-sized cup - like if you're going to nickel and dime your customers, can you at least give us a bigger size cup?",Anya S.,"New York, NY",10/9/2015,4.0
"If I could give zero star I would. This is my first and last time ordering lunch from this place. I ordered 2 pho bowl, and people who packed the food didn't put noodle in ( I understand ropes make mistakes). I called to have them delivered the noodle so my colleague and I can actually have our lunch, but instead they doubt my visual ability and stating that the food packed did put the noodle in. Finally the receptionist said they will deliver the noodle over in 5 to 10 mins. 25 mins went by, I called again, the delivery guy had just left the restaurant. And of course the receptionist had to speak to their upset customer with an awful attitude. Finally the delivery guy showed up after 40 mins. They make this mistake on a Saturday; I wonder what type of mistakes they would make on the busy weekdays.

Yes I ordered on Saturday, April 9th. What I mostly upset about was the attitude of the receptionist who communicated with me on the phone. Thank you for looking into it.",Cindy T.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",4/20/2016,1.0
"We had lunch here today and the Pho Bo was outstanding! The broth was perfectly seasoned and the ingredients just right. My husband had the Thai fried rice with pork chop-he loved it! We also shared the spring rolls with lettuce. The dipping sauce was delicious. They also had a Sapporo pitcher/ sake combo for $16. Great deal and a perfect accompaniment.
The service here is attentive and very friendly. Highly recommend this little gem! Go. Eat. You'll be glad you did.",Marion R.,"Tucson, AZ",7/19/2014,5.0
I think I just found my favorite new Thai staple in nyc. Not just because it's a block from my office either. The food is fresh and delicious. I've tried about a 1/3 of the menus by now and haven't been let down yet. In fact it keeps getting better. The pork belly rocks. The staff is also really friendly and fun to watch from the bar. They are a well oiled machine. No need to go anywhere else.,david w.,"Los Angeles, CA",11/10/2015,5.0
"I am a FAN!
No wait + tasty food + good service + cheap = frequent visit

We got mango fried rice, clay pot shrimp and spicy calamari. And all were very good. I am so surprised that this place isnt more popular... Would definitely go back to try the other 100 items on their menu",N W.,"Manhattan, NY",9/28/2013,4.0
"It was one Summer Evening and my wife and I decided to try a new restaurant.  We had OBAO deliver the food to a roof top location on 38th St. & 6th Ave.  

The delivery service took over one hour and is unacceptable to NY delivery standards.  I don't have time to wait for you to bring me my food, my 8ss is hungry.

Before we began devouring the food we noticed that the food was cold.  We had ordered Pad Thai with Shrimp, Summer Shrimp Roll, Chicken Satay, and a couple of other dishes which the other couple that had joined us.  The food quality was pretty bad.  My Pad Thai dish was more oily than a chick in a Proactive Pimple cream commercial.  The meat was way to cold and we were extremely dissatisfied with the experience.

I would definitely never order from Obao again.  There are a million other restaurants to choose from in NYC.  Good luck and stay Hungry my friends.",Freddy V.,"Brooklyn, NY",8/18/2013,2.0

"Love the beef luc lac.

Bun bo hue was pretty close to authentic as compared to Vietnam or west coast bun bo hue, which is very rare in NYC.

the eggplant appetizer was very close and authentic to c√† t√≠m nuong mo h√†nh so a huge huge plus for them for that

the dill fish dish sounded like cha c√° la vong, but  the fish came fried, not grilled, and way too salty, not delicate like the Hanoian version, but even though it wasn't authentic, it was pretty good.

the green tea panna cotta was amazing! I crave it so much! I wish they open later so I can just go there for this.

basically a solid menu, everything i've tasted has been at least good.

Service is mixed. sometimes there are cute waiters that are very nice and helpful, and sometimes i get the sense that the waiter just wants to get me out of there as quickly as possible. There's been more than once that they are very obvious/blunt/tell it to our table that they are closing and we need to leave. This is still a few minutes before 11!",N L.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",3/24/2013,4.0
"I must've ordered the wrong dish cuz the reviews were much better than the actual.  

I went there for lunch and the ""free starter"" with entree was a good deal...BUT the so-called starter can be a dish of corn or something, not necessarily like a real appetizer.  So ordering the fresh shrimp rolls, which were good by the way, is an extra 6 bucks to my lunch.  

Let's talk about the entree...now, maybe I should've stuck with a pad thai, I mean, c'mon, how can u mess up pad thai...it's thai street food, u gotta be a genius or someone who needs cooking 101 to screw that up.  Anyways, I ordered a pho cuz the picture looked good and some ppl even said the beef were thinly sliced...WRONG...those ppl probably have never had really thinly sliced beef pho.  Mine were like 2mm thin...so if I can actually measure the thickness, then it's not thin.  With only 4 pcs of chewy beef (2 pcs with a chunk of fat on them), not much for this bowl here.

The only thing that saved my meal was the durian shake cuz i like durians so that was satisfying.

I might go there again to try out their pad thai and conclude my opinions on this place, but not really recommending this place for thai or viet because it's average cooking on both sides to me especially the vietnamese side.",Jackie P.,"New York, NY",3/4/2013,2.0
"Good, comfortable atmosphere and Asian inspired decor. Great service. Our server was friendly, informative and helpful.(I didn't get her name but she had an Australian accent) I asked for their house specialities and she made great suggestions.

"Great Vietnamese and Thai restaurant in Hell's Kitchen. I love the hanging lamps and up stairs gold-bell decorated ceiling. I stopped for a happy hour drink at the bar before my dinner at 8. The drinks were way too light and sweet for my taste do we decided on basic hot sake for the rest of our dinner. We had the seafood clay pot, duck red curry and the saut√©ed flank steak with peppers. Everything was good, the clay pot was a little too salty for my taste and needed actual variety in seafood. The servers all spoke Thai so my boyfriend felt at home! Overall great service.",Plur F.,"Richmond Hill, NY",10/16/2015,4.0
"I rarely write reviews; when I do, it's either for a very good experience or a very bad one.

Wife and I were craving Asian inspired cuisine after work this evening. We walk in and are promptly seated. Waitress begins to take our order and I state that I want their $11 special; to which she curtly replies, ""Yeah, which one"". Instantly, I knew we were in for an attitude appetizer and poor service for the main course!

After my wife orders, the waitress turns her attention to two ladies dining next to us. They wanted to split the payment over their respective cards, to which the waitress quickly points out that they have a minimum and can't do that. They begin to pay with cash as the waitress waits around, like a vulture, which seems really rude. Perhaps because of this, they miscount the tip and the waitress replies, ""Wow, one dollar tip!"" I was shocked to hear that!

So, now our food comes. It was good. Water? Not refilled. My soda? Not refilled, until I asked for a refill. We finish, get the bill, and find out that they charge for a refill! I tell the waitress that they should note that soda is by the glass, to which she replies, ""Yeah, sorry"" and takes the credit card without even being sincere or concerned. Showed a complete lack of integrity.

A few things:

1) this place was not even half full, in fact, it was only 6pm, but we experienced poor service
2) it takes so much for a company to build a solid reputation and so little to break everything down. I've come here in the past, but because of this experience, I will no longer be coming here or suggesting others come here.
3) The food was good. In fact, very good. But there are a bunch of other places with good food served without attitude and I would rather patron those places than this place.
4) Waitress - you deserved that $0 tip",Dan P.,"Manhattan, NY",9/22/2014,1.0
"I like their pho bo. It grew on me because I can't get decent pho near my office so I come here often and get pho every single time. They offer a myriad of other dishes though. The service is usually pretty quick and the pho comes out even quicker. Summer rolls are spot on too. The only strange thing I noticed was that they don't give you the hoisin or sriracha sauces with your pho, you have to ask for them. I guess not many ppl ask for them.

It's pricier than Chinatown pho -- $9 but they're a Michelin starred restaurant so I guess that justifies the price. Damn, I love pho so much.",Jen R.,"Los Angeles, CA",4/5/2013,4.0

"We'll be here once a week, I declare! I took a take out menu ones as I pass this place almost everyday on my way to work, studied the little paper with some enticing dishes on the list, we decided to try and we were hooked ever since. We were just here for our 4th week and I'm still excited for the next one!

And oh, did I mention that my OBao craving usually falls on a Thur, Fri or Sat?  Maybe because OBao have $2 apps and $1 sake, kamikaze shots on those days! :)

For the price, you do get something some places in Manhattan don't offer, quality.  Good, strong broth; a not insignificant portion of beef; could do with more noodles, but that's just me I suppose.  Also got the spare ribs on sugar cane skewer.  VERY tasty.

"Another Asian Fusion place. Food was OK but not authentic.
My husband and I went for lunch and they sat us in one of the small tables near the entrance. They had the door opened and it was cold so I asked if we could seat in the main room in the back and a rude waitress told me that it wasn't opened yet. I'm not kidding, about five minutes later as more people came in they sat them in the main room.  I don't understand why she refused to sit us there!!  I had to keep my jacket on during my entire meal.",Veronica A.,"Manorville, NY",4/25/2014,3.0
"Obao is new to the Michelin Bib Gourmand list and it was right around the corner from Okeanos so we decided to give it a try.

It's an Asian Fusion restaurant so we got a lot of different dishes and shared:

- Crispy Pork Belly (Good but not great)
- Spicy Lemongrass Kalbi (really good)
- Clay Pot Catfish with Caramel Sauce (really good)
- Pad See Yew (really good)
- Chinese Broccoli in Oyster Sauce

We also had brought our own wine (Gioja from Castello di Amorosa).. we don't mind a $20 corkage as long as it allows us to bring what we like.

There were no bad dishes and several really good dishes, so it's a solid 4 stars.  It would be fun to come here with a larger group and order a lot more of the menu.",Chad T.,"Manhattan, NY",5/8/2011,4.0
"How can I not give this place 5 stars when I come back time and again for lunch and dinner and have loved every dish that I've tried? The food is consistently inviting and flavorful. Just to name a few, I have enjoyed the papaya salad, bo luc lac, chicken green curry, kra pow gai, and the shrimp pot. I've only gotten dessert once and it was tasty too -- try the chocolate forest.",amie b.,"Manhattan, NY",1/20/2016,5.0
"I've been to OBAO three times and each time the food was very satisfying. The dishes were fusion in concept but authentic at heart. My stomach finds them quite comforting when I'm craving for some Asian noodles afar from home.

Dishes I've tried and loved:
- Japanese grill eggplant
- Pad Thai
- Pad See Ew
- Spicy Lemongrass Kalbi
- Pho

Especially now that I discovered they serve one of my favorite childhood dessert- black sticky rice, I'll definitely be back in no time!

The place is good for a low-key date or large groups. The front of the restaurant can get hot in the summer, so try to score a seat in the back room.",Ang S.,"West Hollywood, CA",7/9/2013,4.0
"Great ambience, mediocre food. Nothing special. Overall the food taste bland.",Ashley N.,"New York, NY",9/14/2015,2.0
"How does an Asian restaurant in NYC get away with not serving brown rice? Food at OBAO is delicious, but not being able to order brown rice kills me.

I come here frequently for lunch when I'm craving Thai food. Their Tom Yum soup is on point- just the right amount of lemongrass and spiciness. I also enjoy their Pad Thai (comes with a poached egg on top) and Shrimp Prik King. Salt and pepper shrimp doesn't have much going on, it's exactly what it's called.",Roham U.,"New York, NY",12/28/2012,3.0
"Pondered ordering take-away from either Obao or Hot Kitchen across the street. Decided on Obao because they offered 10% discount via their  SimpleMenu online ordering. The take-away pickup was late, the food was unremarkable midtown fare and, of course, there was no discount. The cashier didn't think it was a major issue and was pleased to dismiss my complaint without regard. Heading across the street to Hot Kitchen next time.",D R.,"Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, NY",1/6/2015,2.0
"Stumbled upon this with a friend for lunch as normal sandwich shoppe was closed. We both had the pho bo and enjoyed it. Nice salty taste and fragrant broth, meat was fresh and thinly sliced, noodles were a good texture. Served with bean sprouts, lime, herbs (jalepeno instead of chili).

We would definitely return for the pho, as we love it and find it difficult to find good versions around NYC. This was a very good version.",Lauren D.,"Chicago, IL",12/28/2015,4.0
"Went to Obao for a casual dinner date after discovering it here on Yelp a couple days ago.

We had the crispy spring rolls with lettuce wrap and spare ribs on sugar cane skewer for appetizers. Wouldn't come back and order them again.

For entrees I had the Bangkok chicken platter and my girlfriend had the pork belly with Chinese broccoli. Not bad. But again, not worth coming back for.

Overall, the food was too mediocre for the price.",Martin A.,"Brooklyn, NY",10/12/2013,2.0
"I was Obao's biggest fan for a long time, visiting 1-2 times per week, but my last TWO experiences there have convinced me not to return.  In both cases food arrived after a massive delay, or cold, or both.  When we tried to correct the situation with waitstaff/management we were told: that the food wasn't cold (?), then that they were going to reheat it (!), then that we would not be permitted to cancel the order, even after being told they were basically going to nuke it and after waiting way too long  (my dining companion was still waiting for her food at 12:50 despite  us having arrived at 12:10.)

I would never normally slam a place in a review - but since this happened twice and management was adamantly unhelpful and rude despite being alerted to the situation (which was real, not some imagined ""I don't like the way my food tastes"" thing), I'm sad to say I could never go back.  It was the best of its kind in Midtown, but with attitude and service problems like that, I'd be shocked if it lasts another six  months.  I just don't think twice with the same problem could be a coincidence.  Too bad.  I'll miss them.",Saint T.,"New York, NY",9/26/2012,1.0
"After multiple visits, I have to say the pho bo is the only consistently decent dish. In terms of pho quality, it cannot compete with even Chinatown pho, but when you need your pho fix in midtown, this should hold you over. Soup broth is flavorful and you do get a decent amount of meat in proportion to the size of the bowl.

In terms of appetizers, do not even look at the spring rolls. The coating was not really crispy or flaky, the ingredients inside did not look or smell good, and they just tasted old. Sorry, but they are not good. The pork belly was decent, sitting in a sticky sweet sauce. If the outside were a bit crispier, it would have been better. The sugar cane spare ribs are creative but the spare rib meat texture is very unusual. It does not feel like you're eating meat.

Among other things, the BBQ kalbi has a lot of flavor, but the meat is usually slightly overcooked and a bit tougher than it should be. Service is always slow so expect to have to wait  to get your server's attention, which I'm assuming is due to the lack of staff. The menu lists some pretty good happy hour deals, but I haven't been able to try them out.

My recommendation only goes to the pho bo, but even then, that's only if you need to satisfy a serious pho craving in midtown.",Enoch H.,"New York, NY",8/22/2012,2.0
"This was one of the worst experiences I have had eating out in NYC. Three of us went there on a Friday night and the service was terrible. They had several servers who came to our table to take the order, got it wrong and were generally just confused.

The food was disappointing as well. The Claypot fish was bland and the claypot Shrimp was so ordinary.

I would not recommend this place at all.",Anu K.,"Manhattan, NY",3/3/2014,1.0
Prett standard Thai food. Nothing special. The actual restaurant is set up nicely- cute for a casual bud dinner or lunch.,Sumiti U.,"Manhattan, NY",6/19/2015,3.0
I've been coming to Obao for lunch after much seamless dining from here.  Really love this place.  It captures the casual asian street food vibe it aims for.  Sit on wood picnic tables or booths in a backroom that is transportative.  The food is prepared beautifully and is delicious.  The prok belly with chinese broccoli is mouthwatering.  The lemongrass short rings are amazingly tender and well spiced.  The tom yum seafood soup is chock full of seafood and spicy just like I like it.  Service has been top notch everytime we eat here.  Highly recommend.,Scott S.,"Short Hills, NJ",12/22/2014,4.0
"Loved Obao! I've been there a couple of times and am happy to say that I've had really consistent service and great food each time! It's Asian fusion so they have a bit of everything, Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese which is great! Mad kee pow and the green curry are my 2 favorite dishes and would definitely recommend them. The vermicelli bowls are pretty good too, the pork and shrimp bowl is very tasty.

The restaurant is pretty narrow but goes back pretty far. They can accommodate larger parties by pushing tables together in the back. I like Obao's dim lighting at night as it can be great for a casual date night or give you the relaxed lounge feeling while enjoying a few cocktails.

Speaking of cocktails, they have a good happy hour Sunday to Wednesday with $2 draft beers and $5 specialty cocktails.",Sarah L.,"Saint Louis, MO",4/10/2013,4.0
"My boyfriend and I had a nice dinner here last night, but the food wasn't spectacular. We sat in the back area and had great service, but his pork belly was less crispy than hoped for (almost reminded me of a tilapia) and my beef green curry was a very confusing dish and impossible to eat!",Michelle C.,"New York, NY",5/7/2015,3.0
"Their menu is not very extensive for vegetarian options. The Singapore noodles that I had was okay - freshly prepared in a wok in front of us, which was cool, but bland and dry in flavor. Service was a little abrupt and rude too..",Shradha A.,"Austin, TX",3/1/2013,3.0
"Obao = o toilet

There's a reason it's grade pending.....",Julie P.,"Philadelphia, PA",7/11/2013,2.0
"Overrated.

Food:

Overall, not so great. Arrived at around 9 and almost all food was lukewarm at best. Either excessive coat of sugar or just bland.

SAMBAL SPICED CALAMARI: Ok dish. Nothing special. A coat of sugar on the outside.

SPARE RIBS ON SUGAR CANE SKEWER: tastes like leftover.

Some sort of shrimp appetizer (can't find it on their online menu): One of the best of this dinner. Again, a coat of sugary stuff on the outside. At least it's warm enough to eat.

LOBSTER PA TAI: Looks great, nothing special. Way to sweet to my taste. Was hoping combination of lobster and pa tai can create something interesting but it was just on the looks.

BEEF LUCLAK: cubes of beef apparently low grade. Very chewy, bland.

Some grilled whole fish: bland. lukewarm. barely edible.

The berry mojito: weak. looks ""dirty"". no flavor. meh.

Seating: 3 of us first chose the seating in the back of the room under those Buddhas, however, the entire section was vibrating like crazy, feels as if there's an airplane hovering over the building constantly. Was told it was the AC and there's nothing they can do about it. IT'S HALF OF THE RESTAURANT!",Shan C.,"New York, NY",2/6/2014,2.0
"There are so many restaurant options on this block, including two Thai places, but Obao is definitely on the nicer end compared to the others. Small dining area in front, but lots of tables in the back for ample seating.  Trendier than I was expecting - great decor and low lighting, good for dates.

Appetizer: crispy fried tofu with sweet/sour sauce was awesome, great flavor.

Entree: eggplant/tofu in spicy garlic was my favorite, get it!  Also basil fried rice is a must.  Mushroom vermicelli noodles were ok, too much lettuce and random stuff on top.

Portions are large, we probably ordered too much food. Great value for the $$.",Ashwin M.,"New York, NY",10/21/2012,4.0
"This place is like a vietnamese/thai fusion type of restaurant. I thought it was alright, only because I'm incredibly picky about my thai food.

Their Pad See Ew is actually pretty good, a bit on the sweet side for my taste buds, but none the less, really promising. Noodles was a very doughy but delicious!

Their pork belly has little to no fat and was very flavorful, but kind of dry.

Basil fried rice was mediocre and wasn't anything special. Wouldn't recommend ordering this.

Overall, only OK. Probably wouldn't come back.",Jessica L.,"Burlingame, CA",3/29/2013,3.0
"I really wanted to like this place when I ordered delivery, I did.  

Two things stopped me: (1) the lettuce in the lettuce-wrapped spring rolls was incredibly soggy (why not package it separately from the greasy spring rolls?); and (2) the eggplant was undercooked and crunchy.  Also, super-pricey for the small amount of food you get.  Moving on.",Marie O.,"Seattle, WA",9/6/2012,2.0
"The midtown east location is very close to me, so I've gotten take out from them a couple of times.  I've enjoyed the Laksa and the Chiang Mai Noodles, but I LOVE the side of saut√©ed bean sprouts with garlic chives.  They are delicious and I'll order them every time!",Danielle F.,"New York, NY",5/22/2015,3.0
"hmm...Ph  soup was good, but the portion tho, so little of meat for the price I paid. I agree it's expensive here but still...i can buy ramen somewhere else with more meat (im such a carnivore lol). Vietnamese Caf√© was good, not excellent, they diluted it too much. Overall, good spot for lunch...too little beef for Pho (it's called ph  b√≤ for a reason...and Vienamese food is not supposed to be stinky on meat)",Kate N.,"Bronx, NY",1/22/2016,3.0
"Used to come here at least once per week for lunch.  The lunch deal was awesome and the service always fast.

The new menu is much more expensive, and somehow the service feels like they're understaffed.  Smaller sizes and bland flavors are not helping.

It's never easy to keep a business open on NYC, much less in the thin-margin restaurant industry.  However, higher prices for lower quality is not a winning strategy.",Meems Z.,"Manhattan, NY",10/19/2015,3.0
We ordered 3 dishes besides fried rice. Chicken was good. Penang beaf was good also. But catfish was very ok. Service was not good. Will not go back.,Tahir A.,"Orlando, FL",12/29/2014,3.0
I have been to Obao at least 4 times with my family. I have a dairy allergy so Thai/Vietnamese is usually a safe bet for me. We LOVE the food and the ambience and the service!,Becca W.,"Larchmont, NY",1/13/2017,4.0
"I was super-excited about pork belly on the menu but was sadly disappointed.
The pork belly with Chinese broccoli was SO dry, I had to ask for extra sauce (I never do this). The piece was also very lean, not pork belly-like at all. There was no ribbon of yummy fat.
The wings were alright, but didn't win me over with flavor as Asian wing sauce usually does.
and lastly the chicken/sausage sticky rice was just lame. Aside from the yummy rice part, the chicken and sausage were really just not tasty.

Nothing was awful, but for $72 dinner ( two glasses of wine included) I was not enthralled.",Yon L.,"New York, NY",3/26/2013,2.0

"The happy hour deals here are fantastic!

I tried the pork belly, grilled Japanese eggplant, and the pad see iew. All three were good. Pad see iew was my favorite and probably the best value of the three on the regular dinner menu.

Good service, pleasant atmosphere, delicious food.",Ronda R.,"Manhattan, NY",12/3/2012,4.0
"Got the BBQ pork chops with rice & got one piece of the meat in a big bowl full of rice. They are not flexible with accommodating requests. Water from the AC was trickling on top of me...so not happy with you, Obao!",Melissa O.,"Manhattan, NY",8/13/2014,1.0
"Thank GAWD there is a place to have pho above 14th street. And it's not bad!! The only thing that would make this place perfect is if they would have Banh Mi, my other mirage-in-the-UES-desert item (I'm jk, I love the UES!).

Go for the happy hour specials. When I went on a Friday it had a selection of appetizers for $2 a plate or something ridiculous. Not for BS bowls of peanuts or something, either. We're talking legit meat, people! Definitely worth it.",Shiori I.,"Manhattan, NY",3/13/2013,4.0
"I came here because my favorite pho place, Bar Bao, recently closed, and I wanted to try its chef's other restaurants.  The pho at OBao disappointed me.  That said, OBao is a nice place, and I wouldn't mind coming back.

* Appetizers: the curry catfish satay is wonderful.  The veg spring rolls are overfried.  The lamb in betel leaf was not bad, tasted a bit like kafta kabob.

* Non-pho entrees: friends got various dishes and liked them.  I can't remember the details, but their dishes looked delicious.

* Pho: disappointing.  The broth was good--not outstanding, and not as good as Bar Bao's had been, but still, good.  The beef, however, was well-done by the time I got it.  OBao serves pho bo, which I think is supposed to have some well-done brisket in it.  But I think it is also supposed to come with some rare/raw beef (which then cooks in the broth).  All the beef I got was already well done.  This makes a big difference.

* Music: they played what sounded like a mix of Blonde Redhead and Vampire Weekend for most of the 4 hours I was there.  Not bad!

* Drinks: they had some interesting cocktails ($12-16) and a few SE Asian beers ($6-7).  Skip the Chang (a beer should not taste like tea!) but try the Tiger--it's a light, sweet lager.  It reminded me a bit of Red Stripe.",Daniel B.,"Ridgewood, NJ",5/23/2010,3.0
"212, that's all you need to know. $2 Sapporo all night  and $1 shot and $2 appetizer from 5-7pm, that's a pretty amazing deal.

Love the pork belly. I had their shrimp & pork vermicelli, it was hmm hmm good!",Fawn Q.,"Fargo, ND",11/8/2012,4.0
"I've ordered off of seamless here many times and have eaten at the restaurant once. I love the fire woks they use in the restaurant. I usually get the same thing over and over. Nothing wrong with changing tried and true right?

I am not a huge fan of pad thai here in NYC. Coming from Chicago I really liked the way pad thai was prepared at Cozy Noodle or Zoba or even Ruby of Siam, but this place cooks it pretty well. I usually get the shrimp and chicken dumpling (which is more like a shumai but whatever) along with the beef balls soup and the shrimp pad thai. the beef balls soup is basically like a pho broth with bo vien (beef balls). It's really tasty and flavorful. Highly recommend!!",Harry L.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",2/21/2013,4.0
"**UPDATE**

Went back again and had the Pho, green curry, and calamari. Every dish was pretty bad. Not going to return in the future.

---------------------------------------------------

One of those hit or miss places. Not a fan of waiters being too chatty with you because it can get annoying. I'm sure that their intentions are harmless and they are being friendly, but sometimes I just don't feel like having a conversation.

This is one of those places where it's okay to eat alone and it's casual. Food can be great, though not always consistent.

1) Chang Mai noodles: noodles in a spicy, curry broth-- tasty and good

2) Pad see iew: rice noodles, egg, beef, Chinese broccoli, topped with mango kimchi-- tasty and good

3) Thai iced tea-- too sweet",LV C.,"New York, NY",3/11/2013,2.0
"I have been there several times and it is definitely one of my favorite Vietnamese places in Mid-town east. The service there is awesome, and lots of different food choices.

At first I think the restaurant is very narrow, but goes back it is pretty far. You can enjoy the sunshine at the back at lunch time.",Ashley Z.,"Manhattan, NY",5/28/2013,5.0
"Ordered the Pho Bo and the fried Vietnamese rolls.
I could tell that they refried their rolls that had been made earlier in the day...soggy, flavorless and dripping in oil. I asked the manager about it and he confirmed saying that they ""twice"" fry their fried vietnamese rolls and recommended the fresh spring rolls. It arrived 1 min later and after one bite, i knew that they too had been made much earlier in the day. The rice paper was completely dried out in the middle.
I pointed this out to the manager and he politely said it is because they make them in the morning.
This is a sit down restaurant and they served me rolls at 5:30pm that they made ""in the morning"". To top it off, this is what the manager recommended.

FYI, I normally do not give negative reviews but this experience was so surprising and disappointing.",Leah M.,"Los Angeles, CA",8/9/2015,1.0
Decent Thai with reasonable prices. Great happy hour as well even though I didn't take advantage of it. I had the Pad Thai and it was a very good version of it. A bit Americanized but still good for your Thai fix in the area.,Cynthia M.,"Manhattan, NY",12/30/2014,4.0

"I was very, very, very disappointed. I placed an order for the first time for lunch today for delivery to my office. I placed the order at 12.08 PM. At 1.45 PM, I still had not gotten it. I called the restaurant 3 times and I was put on hold for forever only to hear that my order was on the way. But I never got it. I called finally to cancel. It's too bad. I never got an apology from them. VERY, VERY BAD customer service! Never again!!!",Natalie S.,"Stamford, CT",7/30/2015,1.0
"A recent business trip to NY had me a bit exhausted and looking for some comfort food, so I plugged ""pho"" into Yelp and OBAO was one of a number of options walkable from my hotel.

On arrival, I was seated fairly promptly, brought water without having to ask for it and offered a drink. Had a decent local beer on tap ( they have three draught options as well as sake, wine and a reasonable drinks menu).

They had just basic pho, which wasn't what I had in mind - looking for some spice, so I instead went for the Bangkok vermicelli. It was delicious with a very good sized portion. That said, once about 2/3 of the way through, the saltiness of the sauce was a bit cutting. Still 4+*.

Went back the following day with my client and we decided to eat 'family style', which gave us both the opportunity to try a few things. *Hint* - It is hard to actually pick just one thing, their menu is fab and it all sounds sooo good. In short, that experience was as good, extremely busy at lunch so be prepared to wait maybe 10 minutes for a seat. We had:

Appetizers:
Chicken Satay - this was decent, chicken a bit dry but the delicious sauce more than compensates.
Spare Rib Sugar Cane Skewers - Wow. These things are to die for. I'll be thinking about these for awhile.

Mains:
Beef Panang - Yum. Beef was super tender, nice & spicy.
Mixed Vegetables - meh. Skip it.

This place knows what they're doing; they have a lineup throughout lunch (it moves quickly, don't let this discourage you) they have plenty of staff on and their bike delivery guys have to hustle like you've never seen. Speaks for itself I think. Go there, have the ribs at least.",Nat L.,"South Central Edmonton, Canada",10/26/2013,4.0
"wow wow wow! These guys know everything about flavor.
I have tried the papaya salad (my favorite), Chicken Vermicelli, Sugar Cane Ribs, Pineapple Fried Rice and Chicken with Noodles.
All those plates were amazing. Specially the sugar cane ribs, surprisingly they were really easy to eat, they came with an unforgettable sauce.
I forgot the name of the plate I ordered last night, the chicken with those thick noodles, oh boy! that had a lot of deliciousness.
The costumer service is very very good as well.",Vanessa R.,"ASTORIA, NY",10/23/2013,5.0

"Had a very underwhelming lunch of fried pork belly and the pho. The pork belly was fairly well cooked but the sauce had a very fleshy taste to it which was almost stomach turning.

The service is very quick as well.",Courtney K.,"Ottawa, Canada",11/7/2014,5.0
"Wow. This place is really good. It's a bit pricey, even their lunch specials are over $10 for most of their dishes, but wow. The food quality is awesome here.

This place is run by Michael Bao Huynh, and he did a great job with this place. The Pho Bo is great, the noodles are cooked perfectly and the broth is so fragrant, yet not salty at all. The brisket is cooked to perfection as well as the roast beef cooked to a beautiful medium rare.They provide, basil, jalapenos, and bean sprouts to add into the soup. On the table is hoisin and siracha.

The chicken pad kee mao was very spicy and cooked well. The broad noodles were cooked well and the chicken was moist and flavorful. The veggies were cooked and seasoned well. The meals were good here. I say this place's pho ranks up to Thai Son,.",Thomas A.,"Watertown, MA",9/23/2010,4.0

"I ordered delivery from here, the shrimp roll appetizer made me want to vomit.  It smelled like rotten garbage, for some reason I decided to taste it (not sure why, maybe because I'm a guy) and it tasted as it smelled. I immediately threw it away.

I also ordered a beef curry entree which was average at best.  I dont think I'll be giving this place a second shot.",Kai R.,"New York, NY",8/15/2013,2.0
"I'd go back.  I ordered the papaya salad, pork belly and pad thai.  All were nicely prepared, had fresh ingredients and good flavor without being too salty or bland.  Also some Thai dishes are way too sweet.  That wasn't the case for the entrees I ordered.  The only negative was the fact that my salad sat for a while before being served.  You can tell because papaya has food enzymes that can start to break food fiber down quite quickly.  Unless you make it and serve it ASAP, it starts becoming a congree of veggies instead of crispy salad.  Otherwise, it's a nice spot.",Allen K.,"Pasadena, CA",6/28/2016,4.0
"Delicious!  I had their lunch special and what a deal!  For $15, I got a small salad, shrimp spring roll and pho.  The salad had dressing on it but I couldn't tell you what it was.  It reminded me of mayo.  Right after getting the salad, the next thing I knew my appetizer appeared and a minute later so did the pho.  I took my time to eat but I wish the plates were served with a little more time in between.  The pho was so delicious!  The beef was lean which is so hard to find.

"I'm about as well-versed on Midtown East dining venues as Newt Gengrich's staff is at collecting presidential primary signatures.  

However, modern technology provides the smoke and mirrors I need to look like an EXPERT.  Using a little Google Maps + Yelp, I produced this winner for lunch yesterday.  

First off, atmosphere - don't let them seat you upfront.  While perfectly suitable, the back is where the action is.  Its a mix of welcoming booths and large communal upscale picnic-type tables.  Also has a small enclosed outdoor seating section.

The food was awesome.  So much so vegan friend (Heather P) decided to head back today for the second day in a row.  She ordered two salads - the Thai Papaya and Viet Payaya salads.  

I had the seafood Tom Yum soup, which by itself was a meal: fish, squid, shrimp, mushroom, lemongrass, red onion and scallion ($7).  The broth was probably the tastiest I've had thus far in NYC...that perfect amount of spice.  Unlike other tom yums, I didn't need a box of Kleenex and a headband to get through the experience.  

Of course I had to cram an entree into my belly, so I went with the Chicken Cashew nuts.  Solid dish, and generous with the chicken and cashews ($10).  (Although my heart still belongs to the same dish made by Aura Thai in no-man's land - i.e. 36th and 9th ave).  

Great lunch specials from 11 to 4pm.",Dominick Q.,"Manhattan, NY",12/28/2011,4.0

"I had lunch here with a friend a few months ago. The lunch deal was fantastic! Each lunch entree includes a small appetizer. The day we went it was a veggie spring roll and we each got one. I had the Bangkok noodles, which were a little spicy for my taste, but I knew that when I ordered. I would definitely like to try something else here next time. A lot of vegetarian options were available for those who would prefer them. Good summer lunch spot because there was an outdoor patio in the back. Also $2 Sapporo drafts at lunch! Can't beat that!",Alyssa S.,"Manhattan, NY",10/4/2014,4.0
"Good food and service at a great price!

One of the few places to get good Vietnamese food in Midtown East. The pho and vermicelli here are great! and so are the appetizers!

It's a very casual / cozy setting with windows that open up directly to the street so a great place to grab a nice dinner when the weather is good.",Erica S.,"Manhattan, NY",8/28/2012,4.0
Consistently great. Pho and Bo LucLac are particularly good.,Jennifer V.,"Manhattan, NY",10/7/2015,5.0
"Fast and simple filled with crazy strong flavors.  I had the Pho Bo and wow was I impressed.  Very fragrant with great textures and the thins sliced rare beef cooks right in the soup - very tender and flavorful.

I also tried the pad thai (great of course) and the flank steak vermicelli (great).  

I would definitely go back.",Sharkus N.,"Hartsdale, NY",9/26/2012,4.0
Restaurant on the west side is way better. They are rude and kind of cold. The food was good but not great.,Avita W.,"Brooklyn, NY",8/20/2015,2.0
"A true 3.5; a small notch above standard.  

Overall, the food is good.  Appetizers were consistently fair; the entrees were slightly more notable (the pan fried egg on the pad thai was an unexpectedly good addition and the lemongrass short ribs got rave reviews from the other side of the table).  

The wine and sake section of the menu could use a little sprucing, and the service could have been more efficient (our waiter struggled with dietary restrictions, but got it together by the end of the meal).  

Probably geared more for a lunch crowd; it's a potentially good choice for a weekday dinner.",J C.,"Manhattan, NY",11/26/2011,3.0
"Small store front, but once you go instead, the waiter brought us to the back, and it seemed that the restaurant just doesn't end! I really like the layout and decorations. We were brought to a covered patio in the back. I was dubious at first because it was quite cold out, but my mind quickly changed when we started to sweat with the well working heat lamps directly positioned above our table. The steaming pho (while extremely yummy) didn't help the cause. Aside from the heat lamps, my other complaint would be they didn't let us split the bill with 2 credit cards (since individually, the credit card amount did not exceed $15). I'm all for small business owners using this tactic to maneuver around credit card company fees, but a restaurant?! ugh",Sui B.,"Jersey City, NJ",4/26/2012,4.0
"Stumbled here while shopping in the area. Didnt expect good vietnamese food here but damn, im impressed.

Pho was good, but not what I want in a bowl of pho. It really like and ""clean"". Im used to the Xe Lua that wham bam knocks you out cold but this was still tasty.

Ate Bun Bo Hue here too and its not oily at all, the cuts of meat are very very chewy so be warned... but so good to eat!

Also had the claypot catfish which is crazy good. the meat just explodes and melts on impact. Salty too so drink that water!

Would definitely come back here to explore. They also have thai/malay on the menu but i think we all came here for viet.

I went on a sunday, so it was empty. Service was great. Good restaurant setting although im really fine with eating in a hut.

Go here!",Linh V.,"New York, NY",10/8/2012,4.0
"After eating here, I really appreciate the quality and price of food at Pho Bang. But just to be fair, Obao is catered to a non-asian, or the midtown lunch crowd. I do not belong to either one of them, hence my 2 stars and review.

Let's see, we ordered their pork belly, Hanger Steak pineapples, bean sprout, herbs, scallion oil, Singapore Laksa prawn, pork, green tea soba, spicy curry broth, and viet coffee.

Pork belly has a good flavor, but it's too big to be bite size, and it's very hard to break it into small pieces with our teeth. So we had a small tug of war with each pieces. The last piece was too tough for our teeth since it was over cooked, so we gave up on it.

Viet coffee was very strong with great flavor, but it was served in an Ikea glass.

Singapore Laksa prawn, pork, green tea soba, spicy curry broth was, um, forgettable and bland. It barely had any flavor.

Hanger Steak pineapples, bean sprout, herbs, scallion oil was ok. Also forgettable and bland.

Again, Pho Bang rocks!!

I would not come back to Obao again and I had to go to Pho Bang to fulfill my dissapointment on viet food.",Dee C.,"Flushing, NY",12/9/2009,2.0
"Amazing food! I went for on the search for a Thai, Vietnamese place and I was so excited to find this place! The prices are just right and the food was so delicious! :) :): :) :) Definitely coming back again for more!",Stacy L.,"Yonkers, NY",7/20/2015,5.0
"This is why I love Yelp. I was looking for a Thai restaurant in the area, saw the reviews on this, and decided to give it a try.

We got to the restaurant so early that we were able to order the early bird special! One appetizer, one entree, and one soda for $10! That's unheard of in NYC!! Deal is only from 4:30 to 6:30 if my memory serves me correctly. We had the steamed dumplings and fried tofu; I really enjoyed the dumplings. I think they were handmade. For entrees, we split the porkchop vermicelli and the obao chicken. The porkchop was delicious. The chicken and rice was seasoned with tumeric and was flavorful!

Oh, did I also mention it was happy hour? $2 sapporos and $5 cocktails. My bf had the mekong river and I had the cocktail with vodka and coconut. Both drinks were perfectly made! Not too sweet, the way I like it. Kudos to the bartending here!

Also, dont let the outside fool you, because the inside is quite large. The back area also has an outdoor space too! I will be coming back for soup noodles!

Amex is also running a $5 off $10+ on foursquare. What a steal!",Tracy M.,"Wyckoff, NJ",7/17/2012,4.0
"They had really decent Thai food. And the dessert was not bad at all. You must try the fried banana and ice cream, with caramel sauce (don't remember the name of it). The caramel sauce was so rich, but not over sweetened. I would love to just have it everyday.",Xi Y.,"New York, NY",1/24/2015,4.0

"Would have given this place 3.5 stars if possible but decided to round it down to 3 rather than round it up to 4. The steamed dumplings appetizer was REALLY good. Nothing wrong with the noodles I ordered, were actually good, but nothing mind blowing or really that special about them. Pretty basic and down to earth Thai food. The waiter was very smiley and nice. Food came out fast but we had to ask for the check and then get their attention to take the credit card (and it wasn't crowded), so they could have been a bit more attentive with that.",Gina A.,"Manhattan, NY",4/27/2012,3.0
"Came here with gf and her friends for lunch on Saturday around noon. We were the first customers of the day. The interior decor was interesting. We all got the lunch special which was an entree and an appetizer. I got the pho which was okay but I had better elsewhere and for a cheaper price. The staffs were very nice. Overall this seems more like an Asian fusion place, nothing spectacular, so I give it 3.5 stars.",Ace C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1/7/2015,4.0
"There's nothing like the flavor of curry when complimented by a slightly sweet coconut taste. I keep raving about the Change Mai Noodles - a soup on the menu - to anyone who will listen. We also ordered the Pad Thai and although it was good, I've had better. In my opinion we were given the best table in the house, a booth right next to the floor to ceiling window. My table plus a few beers, good service and great soup left me definitely wanting to visit again.",Caitlin S.,"Manhattan, NY",9/6/2012,4.0
Average at best. I tried to get the food delivered but after telling the receptionist 4 times that I was staying at a hotel and didn't know the cross street I gave up and walked there. I ordered the chicken pad Thai and had to get the spring rolls since they have a $15 minimum for credit cards.  As previously stated the food is average ( spring rolls were terrible) and if I had more time would have gone somewhere else.,Elizabeth K.,"Alexandria, VA",12/29/2014,2.0
"The pad thai is incredible. I mean, REALLY REALLY good. It's fresh, it has a lot of shrimp included, and the egg on top is just perfect. I add my srihacha, grab my chopsticks and cannot wait to dig in.

I've tried to try other dishes. I think I accomplished this once. I trust they are good too, but I LOVE that pad thai.

The ""free"" appetizer with lunch is usually small and a tasting of whatever they feel like mass-producing. At $10 - $13 for lunch, it's a little pricier than the thai places by my apt, but such is life in Midtown.

It's 10:30 am...is this too early to be thinking about lunch already?",Allison P.,"Washington, DC",9/19/2011,4.0
"Was here for lunch on a Sunday - not busy and we were promptly served.

Everything looked amazing on the menu and I ended up getting the Bangkok grilled chicken platter with papaya salad and sticky rice.
--- Chicken was amazing, tender juicy and well seasoned
--- The way they made the papaya salad was like nowhere else. Seasoning they use is sophisticated that you cannot taste any bitterness from papaya itself.

The problem is with the sticky rice dish - a bit too oily and all the meat in it made the rice oily and salty. Thai sticky rice is supposed to be coconuty and fragrant - which the dish is not.

We also got one ice tea and one ice coffee - CANNOT be unsweetened since it is pre-made.  As expected, it was tooooo sweet and thick - hard to swallow and not suitable for a hot_humid_summer_day.............

Might come back again, but only on occasions when I don't mind greasy heavy food. There are def better places out there - Thai food is not supposed to be this heavy....",Daisy C.,"New York, NY",7/16/2012,3.0
"How have I missed this amazing restaurant with an incredible deal???  I don't know, but I'm happy I've finally found it.  I pondered with my boyfriend after the meal if we would have enjoyed it even if it hadn't cost $10 each.  We both agreed we would, but just not as ecstatically - which is fine.

You have to try the Japanese eggplant appetizer!  The flavors were so good!  I had the chicken vermicelli, which I loved (and it was good cold the next day for lunch, too).  My bf really enjoyed his pad thai.  We didn't even take advantage of the included soda, and still were really happy with the price.

I highly recommend this place!",Samantha G.,"New York, NY",6/1/2012,4.0

"I saw a roach here once during lunch time... but the food is good so I'm going to pretend I didn't see it.

The food is good, but I find the amount of food they give me is inconsistent. Sometimes too little, sometimes just right.

I'm surprised no one has really mentioned their Green Tea Panna Cotta. Rich and light at the same time, and sooo creamy. Delicious!",Peggy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/12/2012,3.0
"Obao has distinctive flavors in their dishes, which I love. I love their pad see ew because they put mango in it, which gives it a nice sweet kick. Their lemongrass kalbi is so sinfully delicious. Overall, I like the food and ambience at Obao but I hate their service. I've been here 4 times and had a negative experience with service 3 times.

This is not a good place if you have a large group (5+). From my experience, the wait staff seems to get overwhelmed if you have 5 or more people. They forget the drink orders and you'll never see your wait staff again after your dish comes out. All these mishaps could have been overlooked if they didn't have such poor attitude when you try to give friendly reminders  

Overall, this place would be good for take out and for parties less than 4.",Tiffany C.,"New York, NY",7/24/2014,3.0
"You really can't go wrong with $2 beers and $1 shots at happy hour (also I think happy hour runs every week night, all night). However, the $3 appetizer special is somewhat misleading. The portions are cut in half from their original size, so it ends up not really being a deal. The spring rolls and spare ribs I tried were OK, not stellar.

The service was really excellent. We were a demanding, heavy-drinking large group and they really accommodated us. The back room is super cute and there's even a little patio, though it was too hot to sit outside.

I will definitely try this place again because I didn't get a chance to eat a real meal. The $10 lunch special looks pretty enticing so I will give it a shot.",Elizabeth D.,"Manhattan, NY",7/17/2012,3.0

Phenomenal authentic delicious.  I recommend to anyone interested in this style of cuisine.  Pho is best ever had,Christopher A. L.,"Tinton Falls, NJ",1/20/2015,5.0
"Obao has its strengths, but it definitely has its share of weaknesses too. First I will say that their crispy pork belly is unreal. Sometimes I order it just to take home and make sandwiches out of it (I heat it in the oven and pile it on a soft hamburger bun with butter lettuce and mayo and, my friend, that is about as close to heaven as you're ever going to get repurposing leftovers). Their pho is pretty good for ""office pho"" as my co-workers and I have taken to calling it. One of my office mates is obsessed with the spare rib on sugarcane skewers. The ""Golden Wings"" are tasty too, although I'd skip the ""sweet chili sauce,"" which is neither sweet nor particularly spicy and has way too much of a vinegar thing going on. This is a pretty serious fail as far as I'm concerned because I LOVE a good sweet chili sauce and this one just does not cut it at all. Chicken Laksa soup is not bad, but also not mind blowing.

Like Jennie A. below, I once ordered the pork over vermicelli and I was not just disappointed, I was repulsed. The pork chop looked like it had been hacked up with a dull machete and there was so much fat and gristle that I couldn't stomach even trying to separate it from the meat. This dish also came with the ""sweet chili sauce."" So unappetizing. This entire dish ended up in the trash, a real dishonor to some unfortunate sow's demise. Few things make me sadder than knowing an animal died only to be subsequently defiled by terrible cooking techniques. It is unjust!

So... long story short, be careful what you order at Obao. It could be great or it could be just downright awful. However, the pork belly, pho and chicken wings are all pretty safe bets.",Maria C.,"Forest Hills, NY",6/14/2013,3.0
My colleagues and I were at a conference and we went here based on some of the reviews. We were VERY impressed. There was 6 of us and every one of us from varying backgrounds and ethnicities all had a fabulous meal from the papaya pad thai to the pho. The ambience and the service were noticeably good without pretention - just what we need and not overpriced. Will definitely go and recommend to others.,Patrick C.,"Washington, DC",9/29/2014,5.0
"The stylish interior was pretty empty late on a Saturday night, and I think I know why. There's nothing wrong with OBao, but there's nothing special about it either.

The apps are a bit one-dimensional, taste-wise. Things perked up with a couple of the entrees: The tasty pad Thai comes with a perfectly poached egg on top, which ""cooks"" a bit more when you smack it apart. The vegetarian duck was spicy and appropriately chewy. The crispy snapper, although too heavily battered, was moist and came with a tamarind sauce that clears the sinuses.

There's Tiger beer, casual service, a patio out back, and fake grass on the walls. It'll do in a pinch, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.",Samantha S.,"New York, NY",1/30/2012,3.0
"Good restaurant with pretty good pan-Asian food (though mostly southeast asian). I've been to Obao a few times, for dinner and for lunch. Lunch on a weekday, Obao is crowded! All the midtown workers definitely patronize this place so just be weary if you plan on eating on a weekday at lunch time. Dinner, the atmosphere is a little more relaxed, especially on a weekend since it's a little slower.

My favorite drink at Obao is probably the sour sop shake---it's deliciously tangy and sweet and reminds me of home. They have a lychee cocktail which is all right but nothing super exciting.

I've had the claypot catfish which was all right--I think it could have been braised longer with a little more fish sauce--not as delicious as my mama's catfish. The salt and pepper shrimp was good but I didn't really taste the chili that was supposed to give it a kick. Still a pretty solid dish. Their pho is good but a bit overpriced (and you have to pay extra to get the beef meatballs which is usually a standard in the recipe). I did thoroughly enjoy the Vietnamese green papaya salad because I swapped out the soy dressing for the chilli lime dressing. Much tastier than the thai papaya salad (even though they claimed they were the same---I disagree). The chili lime dressing is HOT but DELICIOUS!!!! I like it spicy.

The fried banana was good and pretty well made. Save room for it--you won't be disappointed.",Nancy N.,"New York, NY",7/10/2011,4.0
"This was my first time to Obaos. Let me say it is a good sign when ethnic people from where the food (any food) originating from eat at the restaurant. It validates the food as being authentic. This was the case with my dining experience. A coworker and I came for dinner and the place was very busy (another good sign). I will say that the waitstaff was slow and that was the only downside of my dining experience. We started off with the crispy veggie spring rolls which were very good. You get 4 small spring rolls with a delicious dipping sauce. I ordered the vegetarian duck basil and my coworker ordered the ginger chicken and Chinese broccoli as a side.  Both dishes came with rice. Warning the vegetarian duck basil has a meat substitute served with it (can't say if it is tofu or what) which isn't stated in the description on the menu and totally took me by surprise. With the low lighting I had to call the waiter over to make sure it really wasn't real duck. My coworker even tried it and thought it was duck. The waiter assured me it was fake meat and it was vegetarian. The dish was very good and spicy. Loved it. My coworker also really liked her dish. The entrees were very reasonably priced. Overall very atmosphere, great food and I would come back.",Jamison E.,"Sugar Land, TX",4/1/2014,4.0

"I read about OBao in Thrillist earlier today.  I usually read about these new restaurants through e-mails, add them to my bookmarks, and most of the time never end up trying them.  It just so happens that I was supposed to be in the same area as OBao tonight, but what brought my attention to this restaurant were the ""Chiang Mai Curry Noodles""...aka KHAO SOI, a dish I had tried in Northern Thailand and absolutely fell in love with.  Khao Soi originated from Burma and is now a traditional Chiang Mai dish, but is not easily found at Thai restaurants in the United States.  That is why I jump at the opportunity to try this dish when I can.

Unfortunately, OBao is a little too new, even for their own menu.  We were given a ""Preview Menu,"" which had about half of what was on their menu online.  The restaurant has only been open for about 3 day, are still working on their credit card machine and their liquor license, both of which should be up and running within the next week or so.  However, this did not deter from their friendly wait staff, who even tried to accommodate us when I asked for the Chiang Mai Curry Noodles.  Our waitress brought out the chef to see if it was possible to make this dish that was not yet available on their menu.  

Instead, he suggested the Singapore Laksa, which are buckwheat noodles in a curry soup with shrimp and pork.  This was absolutely delicious and did remind me a lot of the Khao Soi, although I hope their Chiang Mai Curry Noodles are spicier than the Singapore Laksa.  I split this dish, along with the traditional Pad See Ew with short ribs, which was also fabulous.  The Pad See Ew also came with something similar to Kimchi, but wasn't made with cabbage.  I ended up using the Kimchi with the Singapore Laksa as a substitute for the preserved vegetables that usually come with Khao Soi.  

All in all, excellent food, excellent staff, and its super cheap!  They have a nice mixture of exotic Asian dishes along with the traditional dishes with a flare.  I am looking forward to trying their Chiang Mai Curry Noodles and seeing what they have in store for their cocktails and desserts!",Veronique L.,"Brooklyn, NY",11/18/2009,4.0
"3.5 stars! Went here with a girlfriend for dinner.
The beef salad was spicy and yummy. The clay pot catfish, while yummy, was not really memorable and reminded me of cheap Chinese food. The 2 dishes were more than enough for the 2 of us and I ended up taking food home.

The service was good and the waitstaff were friendly.  Ask to sit near the back of the restaurant - they had a lot of delivery and the front door opened/closed a lot.",K C.,"Manhattan, NY",4/25/2012,3.0
"Had the crispy pork belly and spicy lemongrass Korean beef. Both were excellent. The atmosphere is nice and dim. Great for dates. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because I'm Asian and i eat rice with everything. The 2 entrees came with one bowl of rice and it was like a half portion. So i ordered another bowl and its $5 for another half bowl of rice. Thus place is fusion but the price they charged for the entrees, the rice should be bigger portions or free like real Asian restaurants. Errr!",Daebin Y.,"Long Island City, NY",1/29/2014,4.0
"Came here for a quick lunch with some coworkers last week and ended up staying here for 2 hours, not because it was so delicious but because we had to wait over an hour for all our food to arrive!

When we got here around 12 it was packed! We were a party of 5 so we had to wait around 20-30 minutes until the hostess finally had a table for us. We actually got a pretty comfortable booth in the back of the restaurant so we were pretty content. Our waiter got to us relatively quickly and we ordered drinks and our lunch entrees relatively quickly.

After he took our order we literally did not see him, or drinks, or our food for at least 30 minutes. After asking a bunch of other servers/busboys who were all running around a little nervously and not getting any straight answers about even where our drinks could be (we had all gotten waters and I had ordered a Thai Iced Tea), our waiter came over with two entrees from our table apologized profusely but immediately turned around and left us again.

We were a little confused because first of all, the lunch entr√©e comes with a free appetizer (not a choice, it's a chef's choice of the day) which none of us had gotten, second of all, we still were missing waters, and lastly the food he brought over was very, very cold. I had gotten the spicy lemongrass kalbi and as bbq, it's generally supposed to be very hot but it was clear that those two entrees had been sitting in the kitchen for a while.

When we got ahold of our water again, he gladly took the two entrees back and reheated them and finally brought back our appetizers, then our drinks. We all guessed that since the place was dying down a little, he finally got back to us and actually remembered who and where we were. For some reason again, it took another 10-15 minutes for two more entrees to come out and yet ANOTHER 10 minute for our last entr√©e to come out.

So all in all, OBAO to me just reminds me of a LOT of waiting...

There are some reasons I want to rate this place better though:

For one the food was great. We had ordered three pad kee maos, kalbi, and shrimp with bamboo and maybe it was because we were all starving after waiting 30 min but everything was really delicious. Even the appetizer, some sort of shitake mushroom spring roll was great.

Another thing was although we did have to wait over an hour for all of our food to get here, the server seemed genuinely apologetic (after he had time to actually come speak to us) and gave us a 25% discount on all our food and didn't charge us for the Thai Iced Tea (or just forgot to...) which was very generous of him.

Lastly, the interior is pretty cool. There's Astroturf on the walls which was kind of interesting and in the back, there's an ""outdoor"" patio seating area which is built around a giant tree.

So, although I had a pretty long and tedious experience there, I would like to come back for lunch sometime for the good food , except this time maybe I'll order out",Nancy S.,"Manhattan, NY",6/28/2011,3.0

"Need to up my review by one star.  The happy hour special is still the best deal in the neighborhood if you want to both eat and drink.  For my most recent visit, my fiance and I tried the crispy pork belly ($2 during happy hour!!!  regular $9) and it was so good, we ordered a second plate.  All the other happy hour apps (tofu, spring rolls, meat balls) are delicious.  For $2 a plate, you can't go wrong.

"Go for the early bird special - before 6:30 PM it's only $10 per person and it includes appetizer, entree & soda!  Portion is good enough to feed one person.

Grilled Japanese Eggplant is yummy!

BBQ Pork Chop over Fried Rice is my highly-recommended dish.  The highlight is the fried rice though not the pork chop.  well, pork chop is good, but you can find it at other viet places too, but the fried rice is unbeatable!

The place is dark and NOISY!  Don't get fooled by the ""Noise Level: quiet"" at the overview above.  It's good for groups, not for a romantic date.",Christine Y.,"New York, NY",10/29/2011,4.0
"The hubs and I went there because they were one of the few places still open after 10pm in the area. We got there around 1015 to promptly be told that they closed at 1045. The website and door said 11pm, but ok no problem since we pretty much already had an idea of what we wanted prior to going. The hubs ordered the Bangkok dish and I ordered the Pad See Iew. The food came out pretty fast, but my dish was brought to me at least five minutes before the husband's dish came out. The chicken in his dish was mushy to the point to where we really didn't even have to chew it. Also, there were literally on three pieces of chicken and three shrimp (all different sizes, a small, medium, and large sized) in his dish.

My dish was actually pretty decent although there was no mango kimchi to be found and the Chinese broccoli consisted of three stems. The Palm beer the husband ordered was pretty good too. Overall it could've been a decent meal had we not been rushed (excuse us for still wanting to spend money even though there were still 45 minutes prior to closing when we arrived). Needless to say we were sat, fed, and rushed out of the door all under 35 minutes. Not ok...we also spent $32 (the meals are a dollar more than what's listed on the website) for crappy food and service when we could've gone elsewhere around here. Oh well.

Great eats and awesome early bird for $10 you can't beat for midtown!,Rose L.,"Petaluma, CA",8/7/2011,4.0
"Called and ordered from here, only they botched my order and refused to admit it. Finally after being passed around to 5 people I get a lady who gives me more attitude rather than apologizing. I told her I've ordered from here many times before and told her to check my seamless history. Finally after 10 mins of arguing  she very reluctantly decided to give me credit for a future order and admitted that ""everyone will remember who I am"". Very comforting.  I won't trust them with my food again and will gladly let the credit go. Worst customer service.",Anup H.,"New York, NY",5/28/2015,1.0
Great Delivery service. Their Pad Kee Mao is so delicious!!!,Daiana A.,"Long Island City, NY",2/1/2014,5.0
"So, my co-worker Jess Z and I are mildly obsessed with Obao. Specifically their Water Street location. Correction, actually she's mildly obsessed and I'm just in love but we were overwhelmingly displeased with the delivery she got for lunch yesterday. We each have our staple dish, chicken with vermicelli noodles (always with double noodle -- because there's just no other way to eat it) and, for lack of a better word our favorite dish was disgusting. I'm not sure why there is such a glaring discrepancy in quality from each location but she received large burned and dry pieces of chicken and dry noodles. Upon tasting it, we each had to spit it out. Completely dis-satisfied, we'd never experience this at Obao downtown.",Valerie V.,"Los Angeles, CA",11/27/2012,1.0
Nice Asian fusion spot with good simple eats. I order dinner from here when stuck in the office during the weekdays which brightens up the mood a bit. Their singapore laksa is yummy and their crispy banana lumpia is a nice subtle dessert to end the meal with.,Diana P.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",8/14/2013,4.0
"I first heard about Obao after visiting Spot, and recently the Ember Room.  Apparently, Obao is the Midtown East sister restaurant.  I wandered in after a fun (cough) day of shopping at the Container Store, and to my surprise, the place was empty!

What was meant to be a late afternoon snack escalated to a full blown meal with an app (the shortrib on lemongrass, charred to perfection); and two uber yummy entrees:  the Shanghai noodles w/chinese sausage and the pork/shrimp vermicilli noodles w/peanuts...yum!  Rarely do I find many places that strike a chord with me at first bite - but Obao was the exception.  I was already planning a trip back before I even finished the last morsel.

Service was super friendly - no surprise, as I find the service at all Chase Restaurants rather pleasant.  

Prices are spot on for quality and quantity.  It's rare that we walk out of lunch for under $30 anywhere!  

Because they don't get much business during the week, they provide ridiculously awesome specials to make up for it...like what?  Oh, like half priced wines on Sundays at 4?  Ladies night on Wednesday..2 dollar beers?  Word.

Can't wait to go back!",Sarina H.,"New York, NY",2/7/2011,5.0
Service was good. I had pho Bo and shrimp salad roll. Pho was really good but shrimp roll's rice wrap was too soft. But it was pretty good experience.,Seong Hee L.,"New York, NY",3/26/2014,4.0
My partner and I had lunch here and were extremely impressed. From the decor to the service and of course the food. I had the Pad Thai portion size was perfect and the flavor and textures amazing. He had the Basil Fried Rice... In a word... awesome. We can't wait till next years visit to NYC so we can eat here again. Maybe next time we will go for lunch and dinner ;p,Doug G.,"Phoenix, AZ",6/17/2014,5.0
"We went here for my birthday lunch and it was evident quite early on that we were being too much trouble to be served properly. I personally made a reservation on Open Table 2 weeks before the actual day (reservation # & all) and was told that we didn't have a reservation. Not only that, I was freaking told that they don't use Open Table. After dealing with the rude hostess for 20 damn minutes (I couldn't storm out and yell I'm going to YELP your a$$ because my friend was running late and it was raining something awful) I was approached by the manager who apologized and gave me s table at the back. Oh fooy! Someone is sitting at the table the manager gave me. Egg on his damn face. I go back to the waiting area and was finally seated after 5 long minutes. My friend finally shows up and we had to ask 3 different waiters for a menu. Three different waiters for a folk, straw and water refill. The food as eh, I'll give it a 6 out of 10. I won't be back!",My Sister's Keeper O.,"Staten Island, NY",10/7/2015,3.0
"I came around 8:30 pm, and I immediately got a table.  I can't say how it's like on most evenings, since I've only been there once.  It's great.  I love their noodles.  I got the Pad See Iew Entr√©e beef, which essentially was the flat rice noodles, with stir fried egg, chinese broccoli greens, green mango kimchi.  It was heavenly.  It had the right amount of sweet, salty, and spicy.  I highly recommend it.  I thought that the wait staff was very friendly.  I liked my Thai coffee.  It was nice and cold on a hot summer evening.  I didn't get to try the Pho or other yummy things on the menu, but I definitely would come back in a nanosecond.",Polly H.,"Queens, NY",6/27/2011,5.0
"2.5 star for the tastiness & authenticity of the food
1 star for the venue's decor
-1.5 star for it being a bit overpriced for what it is.
=3.5 stars total!
I've revised my review from Nov 2010 which stated that Obao's ""shrimp [were not] well-washed & de-veined.""  Since then, they  seemed to have rectified this issue and the shrimp were nicely cleaned, de-veined, and butterflied. OBAO, THANKS FOR LISTENING! The +1 star is also given upon my discovery that Obao serves up a hard-to-find fave dish of mine done right: Daikon cake, which I've had in Cantonese dim sum or in a similar Singaporean or Malaysian ""noodle"" dish, Chai tow kway.  This is Vietnamese version was a stir-fry combo of shrimp, bean sprouts, scallions, & chunks of daikon cake (like gnocchi but made w/ daikon (japanese turnip) in a sweet soy sauce. If you've never had it, I highly recommend it! Obao's is almost perfect...each pan-fried daikon ball has a thin crunchy layer on the outside from frying & is soft on the inside. However, I like mine even crispier & well-done on the outside with little to no sauce.  In addition, Siracha & hoisin sauces are served as dipping sauces to the daikon cake.

Their other dishes:  
Cha gio (fried Vietnamese spring rolls) is better than average & comparable to Saigon Grill's but becomes soggy if taken to go.
Calamari appetizer was a bit chewy & was lightly breaded, salty & peppery, cooked w/ slivers of yummy onions & served w/ a nice complementing sweet & sour cucumber sauce.
Claypot shrimp has glass noodles, Chinese shitake mushrooms, & red & green bell peppers, and long stalks of scallions - it had a good gingery & salty taste. Unfortunately, we ordered this dish to go and are sure it would've been much better had we eaten it in-house in its original claypot vessel.
Green curry w/ beef, eggplant, and bamboo shoots was pretty watery and didn't have the usual heat as that of a Thai curry.
Grilled shrimp & pork w/ vermicelli, lettuce, chopped peanuts, and bean sprouts was pretty tasty but the poor, fatty quality of pork cancels out all positives of this dish.
Overall, Obao dishes out pretty tasty & authentic fare but you will pay well over the average cost of a Vietnamese dish you'd find in C-town here. So, it's fair to say that one would expect not just above-average fare but also quality produce & preparation of dishes...not meat  laden with fat.",ZenFoodster E.,"Manhattan, NY",11/1/2010,4.0
"I heard that OBOA had some Viet items on their menu.  So, during lunchtime, I decided to give this place a try.  Funny thing, I gave it 3 consecutive tries (yes... i went tuesday, wednesday, and thursday).  Each day, I tried out a new dish.

1.  Monday -- Vermicelli with beef and shrimp (aka Bun).  I was pretty happy that they gave you a lot of meat.  However, I wished they had more fish sauce.  Food was pretty good, but not great... Compared to most Viet places that I have been, I thought this was very expensive.  Most places charge like $7-8 for bun; however, they charged $12 ... ouch!!

2.  Tuesday -- Bun Bo Hue... man, i was a bit disappointed.  When they brought this dish out, you expect it to have a very deep red hue (usually, this is an indicator of how good and spicy it would be).  Unfortunately, there were strings of limited red matter.  Soup was a-ok.  Priced at $10... in Vegas, I can get a bowl for $6 and in LA, I can get it for cheaper at $5...

3.  Wednesday -- Pad Thai with Shrimp and Red Snapper.  First thing.. honestly, i tried looking for the Red Snapper.  We asked the wait staff and they told us that it was ""grinded"" in with the peanuts.  Who grinds ""red"" snapper? Honestly, I don't think there was a snapper in there!  Anyways, the meal was decent.  I was served in a rather miniature size round metal bowl.  It was a tad too sweet for my tastes, however, it was not bad.... Kinda pricey at $12 (trust me, you can get a better pad thai in NYC for much less)

As for atmosphere, it was nice and chic.  Granted, during our lunch time, we had a lot of business people around us.  I like their seating in the back.  It felt very open.  I give this a low 4 stars.

Wait staff was very quick, attentive, and polite.  I give them a 4.5 star grade...

Overall, staff was very good, atmosphere good, food was average, and price was a bit too high for the type of food...

"I don't normally write bad reviews, but I'd have to make an exception here. I've dined at Obao at the 53rd st location about 2 dozen times and the food has been good, my only problem with the level of customer service they provide. It seems that everytime I ask for the smallest item I get charged for, one example is when I ordered $50 worth of take out and asked for a cup of ice they charged me  $.50. The second instance was when I ordered a durian shake and asked for the shake to be put in a plastic cup rather then a soup container that was an additional charge $.50 for something that should've been put into a plastic cup to begin with. Finally, when I went to eat lunch when ordering a soup dish, after asking for a rice they charged me $2 for each bowl for a dish that did not come with noodles or at least rice. At this point I wouldn't be surprised if they charged me for each napkin I use. I'm not a frugal person but it's just a matter of principle",Kevin L.,"New York, NY",1/20/2015,2.0
"One of the worst places when it comes to service.....we couldn't believe it. My friend and I came there after 9pm on Monday for dinner when the restaurant was less than a half full. When we'd  sat at a table that sits 4 people, we were rudely asked to move.....but we told the server that we would leave.....he replied that we could leave if we wished.....and we shortly did. I've never been treated that way at any restaurant!!",Christina J.,"Manhattan, NY",4/7/2015,1.0
"Great spot in Midtown East for a sit-down lunch or casual dinner.  The pad thai is great because they include a poached egg, which is not typical of pad thai but makes it yum.  The pork belly with chinese broccolli is really great and a good low-carb option (if you skip the rice!).  The Mixed Vegetables are also really tasty if you want something on the healthy side.  

They include a free appetizer during lunch - nothing big (think mini salad or small serving of crispy noodles) but nice all the same.  And they are very accomodating if you want to make a simple substitution.

It gets quite busy during peak times, but you can make a reservation.  The prices aren't bad for midtown, and they deliver!",M L.,"Ridgewood, NJ",12/4/2013,4.0
"I received the worst service ever today before I even ordered food. The place was empty and it was 30-40 min before they were closing. So not sure who it was (host, server or kitchen guy), but he said with an attitude that we are not supposed to sit there bc it's a table for 4. Ok, I understand if it was a lunch time or they were busy, but having many open tables and 30 before they close, he is making this rude request? And then he said if someone comes then we would have to leave. Not the right way to treat customers",Flamingo R.,"Koreatown, Manhattan, NY",4/6/2015,1.0
"Arrived here at a relatively busy hour, but our party of 2 was seated quickly in the back section by the tree.  Smelled a bit like the rain forest exhibit at the Central Park Zoo, but whatever.  We ordered 1 dish each within 5 minutes of sitting down...and then waited for 40 minutes without any further attention from the staff.  No waiter came by to let us know why our food was taking so long and people who had arrived after us (one table had arrived at least 20 minutes after us) had already been served.  We walked out after the 40 minutes because our lunch hour was nearly gone with 10 minutes to get back to our office.  On our way out, I approached a waiter and let him know we were leaving because the food was taking too long and he seemed bewildered, as if he had not even known we had been waiting.  They should be more mindful of the patrons that they're stuffing into the (smelly) back section.

I'm sure they have better service at less trafficked hours, but I will not be returning to this restaurant.",G S.,"New York, NY",5/16/2014,1.0

OBAO blew them away, I had the Chicken Laksa Soup, it was the best I have ever had by far.  The staff was friendly, courteous, and made great recommendations to us.  I would have rated them 5 stars, but the noise level was a little louder than I am used to.  However, it was a Friday night and there were a lot of people enjoying their night out.  Check them out, it was also very reasonably priced.",Amy P.,"Long Beach, CA",4/18/2013,4.0

"O Bao, how I love thee.  Let me count the ways:

1. You are the only legit restaurant that delivers food in my area on Seamless.  Everything else is crappy Chinese food, crappy Indian food, crappy Greek food, crappy pizza...(you get the gist).

2. You fill my hankering for decent Southeast Asian food without me having to trek all the way down to Chinatown (I shed a tear when I discovered Penang would no longer deliver up to my office...from Chinatown).

3. Your flavors might be all over the place, but they sure work well.  I would give a shout out to all my favorites, but I've tried almost everything now and really you can't wrong.

4. You delivered in 7 minutes flat once.  From the time I received the email from Seamless that my order was received.  And you are located almost 10 blocks away from the office.  I will let Stephen Hawking know your delivery men have found a way to quantum leap through the time-space continuum.

Bottom line: 3.5 stars",Emily C.,"New York, NY",10/4/2010,4.0
"Went for lunch and got the lunch special, which included a free starter with your entree.  The starter turned out to be four or five fried chicken chunks, nothing to write home about.  But then came the pho.

Oh, the pho.  It was absolutely yummy.  The ingredients were fresh, the broth was delicious, and the noodles even tasted better than usual.  It ran my friend and I $13 each, which is a touch pricey, but I'll be going back anyway!",Sunayna R.,"Manhattan, NY",9/28/2011,4.0

The pad thai taste good and the egg normally cook together but at Obao the egg come on top of it and it half cook something new.

I have the laksa,it's was a boo no taste and there use soba noodle for Chinese food,what a mistake the soba noodle taste so strong it cover all the taste of the soup.

Last, I think is overpriced",storm v.,"Manhattan, NY",7/2/2011,2.0

Will be ordering from them again soon!",Sara K.,"Honolulu, HI",9/7/2011,4.0
Three stars may be a little harsh but the place is consistently OK. I go for lunch every once in a while and the noodles and chicken dishes are pretty good. Some dishes are obviously more solid than others. They have good drink specials if you like Sapporo and sake.

"Was walking to a bar to have sliders and a few beers, when a sign caught my eye ""Noodles and BBQ""... No need to say anything else, my friend and I walked right into OBao.

I ordered the Porkchop with Chinese Broccoli and fried rice and tomato. Bleh! One small piece of tomato, and 2 strands of Chinese broccoli. The pork chop was thin, and the fried rice had barely any flavor.

My girlfried had the porkbelly and she really liked it.

The service was SUPER SLOW! The food came out really quickly, but the time it took to order, was just ridiculous.

I took a quick glance at the lunch menu, and for $10, you get a LOT of food! I won't be back though. Would have been happier with my sliders and beers!!",Vivian N.,"Forest Hills, NY",7/13/2011,2.0
Really enjoyed this nice little spot midtown for a casual and very tasty dinner. Loved the eclectic collection of dishes across Asian cuisines. I was feeling more Thai and opted for the pad kee mao and my friend got pork belly with Chinese broccoli. Both were very delicious. Great prices too!

I ordered dinner to pick up (and take back to the office), and the greeting at Obao was totally friendly- as if they were actually delighted to see me.  That was a good start.

In all: inexpensive, fast and friendly.",C E.,"New York, NY",9/27/2013,5.0

Drinks are mixed well and you can't beat $2 Sapporos. Service was extremely slow, however, which startled me because the restaurant was barely half full.

I came with my entire family, which basically consists of a large group of people who have extremely discerning tastes, especially when it comes to Asian food.

We had a great time.  If you like Durian, you HAVE to get the durian shake, otherwise try the Coconut Juice which comes with a few pieces of coconut.

- Spare Rib on Sugarcane Skewer
- Sambal Spiced Calamari
- Short Rib Lemongrass
- Wings
- Beef Salad
- Spicy Lemongrass Kalbi Shortrib
- Clay Pot Catfish

We love coming here when we are in the mood for South east asian since you have a nice mix of Thai, Vietnamese and Phillipines flavors.",Andrey K.,"New York, NY",12/8/2012,4.0
"GOOD, CHEAP FOOD: The food here is cheap and delicious! $12 pad thai like no other place I've been to (there are diced red snapper and a poached egg involved). The $12 pork chops were generous and cooked just right.  

GREAT SPECIALS: We mentioned Yelp and got free beers all around :) (THANK YOU YELP!) We had springs rolls, which although tiny are very good! The 2-1-2 special ($2 appetizers, $1 shot, $2 Chang Beer) is a pretty good deal as Chang beer, to my groups surprise, is actually pretty good!

NICE LOCATION: It may be deceiving from outside, but when you walk into the back dinning area you'll realize that OBao has a great space! There are skylights along the dining area so natural lighting comes through. Additionally a beautiful garden with a built in dining space (nice new wood floor and paneling everywhere).",Claire C.,"New York, NY",7/23/2010,4.0

"I have been coming to the E53rd street location for many many years. The service has very good during that time, the food excellent. However, I have noticed a decline in the service and quality of food recently. It was topped off by an experience last night that was horrendous. To begin with my friend arrived early, ordered a beer under their happy hour listing and was seated in the front of the restaurant. Upon arrival I noticed that the stench of the garbage outside was unbearable and filtering inside so we moved to the back of the restaurant.

We ordered our food, which we both noticed was sup-par as compared to previous visits. When it was time to pay our check the waiter, was extremely rude and beyond obnoxious. He was the small man with a very high pitched voice. We noticed there was a discrepancy on the bill and pointed it out to this little man. The problem was regarding the happy hour beer that my friend had ordered earlier when she was seated in the front waiting for my arrival. I told this little man it was ordered under the happy hour special to which he replied that we had never mentioned we wanted it under happy hour and that we should have told someone. It is not my habit to look at the time when i order beverages knowing that it would be covered during a specified time frame. I also don't feel i need to tell the waiter it was for happy hour since i don't work there. It should be understood that it was for happy hour and not for 'normal' hour. This little man was beyond rude and said that we should have looked at the time we ordered it and told the waiter. Really? I have to look at the time, knowing that it was ordered during the Happy hour timeframe?

In addition, according to the little waiter the beer was 'upgraded' since it wasn't under happy hour. How are we as customers to know when something is upgraded when we thought we were ordering for happy hour? For all we know that size was standard for happy hour. This was completely unprofessional of the waiter to do this.

We decided not to say anything further because we were both beyond fed up. I will say that I will never order nor recommend Obao again based on this experience.  Someone needs to have a talk to him about professionalism, manners and overall appearance because due to the  the way he acted yesterday he didn't give a good impression at all.",Sarah O.,"Jersey City, NJ",8/1/2014,1.0

"I gave this place a second try as my friend convinced me that they are pretty good. We came here for a happy hour. Dining-in was definitely a better experience than ordering for take-out. The drinks were really cheap ( I had beer, which was around $5). The service was pretty good, and the food was better tasting, though I did order a different dish. The first time I had cashew chicken-did not like it one bit. Thist time I ordered a green curry with chicken, and it was MUCH better. As such, I'm bumping this place up from 2 to 4 stars....with one suggestion-Don't order lunch specials, they are not good.",Blake B.,"Brooklyn, NY",4/10/2013,4.0

"Not in a rush?  Want great cocktails at an irresistible price and a little bit of everything Asian? Well, this is the place for you!

Had dinner with a friend last night and was pleased to know there were drink specials.  $5 top shelf cocktails (normally, they're $9 to $12) and $3 beers ALL NIGHT and in midtown?  Now, that's pretty uncommon. I even had to ask the server again if the cocktails were $5 later that night.  As for the food, loved the perfectly crisp and moist pork belly (it came with slivered carrots and radish).  Both the Laos Beef salad and spicy shrimp and bamboo rice dish were tasty but verged on the salty side.   Overall, it's a good place to chill and catch up with friends over Asian fusion food and cocktails.  Another plus is their background music/play list which included Passion Pit and Alberta Cross.

Apparently, they have these unbelievable prices on Wednesday nights for the ladies and HH specials on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.  

FYI, the place gets its business from nearby offices so don't let the low patronage fool you. Also, don't expect to eat and get out of here in one hour-- the service is on the slower side.",Mona L.,"Los Angeles, CA",3/2/2011,4.0
Decent tom yum soup but officially the worst pad thai Ive had. Asked for spicy pad thai in my take out and forget being spicy it was totally bland.

"I may not be a thai food expert but I thought this place was awesome. Great noodle soup. I will be back for more

Cute little Viet/Thai place in Midtown. Their Pho is pretty good (especially for Midtown). The Shrimp Pad Thai comes with a runny egg. YUM! What doesn't taste good with a runny egg?! And you definitely can't go wrong with $2 Sapporos. Good service too!,Paula S.,"Oakland Gardens, Queens, NY",5/2/2013,5.0
"Can here for the lunch special and tried the Singapore Laksa, Beef Pho, and Obao chicken with coconut rice. My favorite by far was the chicken with coconut rice, which apparently they only make 20 a day. This marketing scheme works and I'm telling you this dish is amazing. The chicken is super super super soft and tender, even though it only comes with one chicken leg. The rice is seasoned with tumeric, which is my favorite way to prepare rice, so I loved it. The portion was rather large too so it was a good deal. Why only three stars then? Well the laksa and pho were okay. The pho was nothing special at all. The laksa had delicious soup, since it was made with coconut milk, but there were almost no shrimp or other meats in it. Also, we did not get our choice of starter, which was one measly little pork meatball. If I were to come back, I'd definitely only order the chicken with coconut rice. Also this place gets packed so don't be surprised if you have to wait a bit, lots of seating though so wait shouldn't be long.",Lucy C.,"New York, NY",1/11/2015,3.0
"good spot for quick lunch out of the office,
would never come here for dinner.
they forget to bring you water, but the pho is good",A A.,"Staten Island, NY",10/7/2014,3.0
"The environment of the restaurant is a mixture of casual with a hint of class. Ordered the Obao chicken which came decently on time and it tasted great - not amazing, but well worth it.

I would go back again.",Stephanie Z.,"Manhattan, NY",11/18/2013,4.0
"Horray for Obao. There are FEW places that do a good Pho in NYC, and when I mean few, I mean like 2.  This is one of them.  Their spring rolls are noticebly unique but in a good way. Ambiance is nice as well. Highly recommend.",Cynthia O.,"New York, NY",8/10/2012,5.0

I went to obao very often for lunch. Food is always good but they need to pay attention to the service. Today it's so weird that they put two appetizers in one plate . Don't know why they did it. Trying to save one plate?,Veronica L.,"New York, NY",3/31/2015,3.0
"Long queue at lunchtime but we got a table quickly after asking if it was going to take much longer or we'd leave. Very smoky inside, needs better ventilation. Service was great, polite and fast. Alas, the ""laksa"" would be a huge disappointment to anyone who has ever tried it in Singapore. Whoever eats soba noodles in laksa? The coconut broth was watered down and not tasty like real laksa. You're better off eating a packet of instant laksa from the supermarket.",Alvin C.,"Atlantic City, NJ",9/6/2014,3.0
No words can describe the deliciousness of the Bun Bo Hue. It's life changing! I have to order it at least once a week just to prevent withdrawals but I've been getting it twice a week for the last 3 weeks and I'll be getting it again today. It's a little different every time I order it but it never disappoints.,Ron S.,"Valley Stream, NY",1/15/2016,5.0
"Really disappointed with their service. I called to order for delivery. That's not the right attitude. The lady on phone seemed in a hurry and didn't let me finish ordering so I had to stop her and state ""I not not done ordering!"" She didn't get my name right, and I corrected her, but she said ""Anyway"" and hang up the phone right away. So I called back to cancel my order.",Su T.,"New York, NY",10/18/2015,1.0
"I had a bad experience. I ordered at 6:45 and waited an hour before calling. They said it was on its way but it took another 30 minutes. I knew the food was going to be cold and it was. Not only was it cold, but it was gross. I ordered the noodles with Chinese sausage. It was literally 5 pieces of sausage the size of a nickel. I wanted to bring it to the restaurant and throw it in the cooks face and then punch it repeatedly.",Max M.,"New York, NY",8/24/2012,2.0
"i ordered the pho bo lunch special and wow the broth is flavorful and the bean sprouts were so fresh and included a good serving of meat! i will def be ordering the pho from here again! it would be nice if it came with a side, like a small salad or egg roll.",Christine T.,"NJ, NJ",2/1/2017,4.0
"This place has a cool atmosphere. I had the pad kee mao and my girfriend had the pad tai, both were delicious. They also had my favorite Sriracha sauce on the side. The best part was the desert! I was convinced to get the Chocolate Forest, which was absolutely decident. One of the best deserts I've ever had.",Orson S.,"Manhattan, NY",1/1/2016,5.0
"This is probably one of my favorite places in New York.  The menu reads Pan Asian / fusion, which is usually a bad sign.  But boy was I wrong with the first impression!  I ordered a turnip noodle dish - a play on a traditional Chinese tapas - and the flavors were amazing!  If you like food that is ""delicate"" or ""subtle,"" then forget about Obao.  This place punches you in the face with flavors, and it hits all the right spots!  

I went back again and ordered other items from the menu, and it was no fluke!  This place is consistently awesome.  Big flavors, no pretense.",Rich W.,"Palatine, IL",11/15/2010,5.0
"This place has great quality Thai food.  I get the Pad kee mao and it is delicious whether you order it delivery or in the restaurant.  The place is a little small if you cannot sit in the back, but this is my favorite Thai place in midtown east.",Vin D.,"New York, NY",6/28/2013,4.0
"Not the best food; not the best experience. Mind you, I live in Jackson Heights where I am a train ride away from the triumvirate of Thai food: Ayadathai, Ploy Thai and Sriprapai. This place is so-so, in terms of taste. A defining dish of a good Thai restaurant for me is the Thai papaya salad--so simple and yet so often not well made. OBAO's Thai papaya salad was bland without much lime or fish sauce. The chicken satay was standard, nothing special. The shrimp prik king was skimpy and pretty unassuming. Their pad kee mao had overcooked noodles with not a lot of spice to it. Food aside, we went for dinner during one of the coldest nights and I think they left the air conditioning on, because we were freezing. A cold draft kept blowing in our direction and, with repeated requests to turn it off, we remained eating in the cold. Another thing to keep in mind: if you are using a discount offer, for instance I was with a Bloomberg associate who apparently gets 15% discount, unless every member of the party has a Bloomberg ID, no one gets the discount.",CH K.,"Jackson Heights, NY",2/18/2015,2.0
"My wife has been trumpeting this spot for a while.  And for good reason - my quick lunch yielded an excellent vermicelli topped with mushrooms, tofu skin, and peanuts.  Lip-smackingly satisfying for carnivore and herbivore alike, and reasonable at $8.  The veggie spring rolls were perfectly fried, but not as flavorful.  
The dark wood of the front room gives a comfortable air to the place, but the astroturf on the wall is odd and off-putting.  This didn't seem to bother the group at the table next to me, TV execs discussing production on a show about gun-toting Mormons (no joke).  It was all a blur, really, as my noodles were not long for the table.",Matthew Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",6/15/2011,4.0
"I tried the Singapore Laksa based on the recommendations on here, and I was not disappointed! It is made with a coconut curry base, which is spicy but not in an overpowering way at all. It also comes with this chile pepper puree on the side, which has a unique burnt flavor to it. The dish comes with three relatively large shrimp and pork belly. The noodles I think were of the buckwheat variety, which makes me think they are actually healthy! This place is a must try for the Asian food aficionado! Not too pricey either, with tax and tip i think my portion was $12.25.",James C.,"Montclair, NJ",6/14/2012,5.0
"I had Drunken Noodles and Chai and I found both to be delicious and affordable. I had mine delivered and they did happen to lose my ticket, but after I called they quickly prepared my meal and delivered it to me.",Andrew W.,"Manhattan, NY",8/30/2015,5.0
"Pad Kee Mao. I've never ordered anything else from Obao, although I've been probably a dozen times. It's just that good. Add a Sapporo for like $2 and I'm in heaven.",Stacey M.,"Boulder, CO",5/27/2013,5.0
"Everything about this place is poor to mediocre from start to finish. Service lagged from seating to providing a menu to taking a drink in order, and so on and so forth. Remember making eye contact does not necessarily mean you will get any attention from the waitress. Also initially our booth area smelled like cheese vomit. It got vented out fairly quickly, but not appetizing start. Moving on to the most important part- food. We got three different kinds of noodle soup. I got the Singapore laksma- it was not to my liking at all. They claim it is spicy on the menu but honestly it's just a pool of very thin coconut soup. The only soup that was good amongst our orders was the Chung Mai- not sure if that's spelled correctly, but this was the only decent entree we received. The appetizers were okay. Portions were very good for the price, but I would not go back as the quality & service was lack luster.",Liz J.,"Paramus, NJ",3/6/2015,2.0
"Went for lunch with my dad. I had pho and my dad had beef pad see ew (I've seen it spelled different ways). They brought out samosas for apps for free. They came with a vinegar sauce which was weird but good. Food came out fast. Both dishes were solid. Pho had a nice broth. And the beef in the pad see ew looked to be pretty high quality. Cheap lunch specials so we got out of there under 30 bucks for the two of us with sodas, tax, and tip.",Scott P.,"Manhattan, NY",8/5/2013,4.0
My friend and I had noodle dishes (I had the pad thai) and it was pretty good...not the best ever but good.  Our waiter had zero personality and was not very attentive but it really wasn't much of an issue.,Amber W.,"New Haven, CT",1/3/2013,3.0
"Obao has a lot of really solid happy hours/specials, including an early bird dinner special for an appetizer, entree, and soda for $10. I got crispy tofu (appetizer) and the pork belly (entree). The portions weren't extremely large and the pork belly wasn't as flavorful as I expected, but the service was fairly quick. For a $10 dinner, that's not much to complain about. The restaurant tends to be really cold, so avoid sitting next to the walls (where the AC runs).",Jenny F.,"Cambridge, MA",11/25/2012,4.0
"Come here for the ""early bird"" dinner special - which goes from 4 to 6:30 (which isn't so early!) - as long as you order before 6:30, you get an appetizer, a soda and a main dish for $10. Good, delicious, plentiful food. The Pad Thai is deliciously fresh and egg-y, and the steamed dumplings (shrimp + chicken) are great.  

Unlike most thai places they only offer say, ""Shrimp Pad-thai"" but they are easy about substituting in chicken, for instance, if shrimp isn't your thing!

Big space too- front room, back room, and an outdoor patio way in the back for warmer weather.  Good service - my water glass was never empty - and they were cool about me and my friend sitting there for almost two hours on a weekday night.  

$15 minimum on credit cards fyi.

My favorite midtown east place to meet up with friends!",Jenna C.,"Manhattan, NY",2/14/2013,4.0
"It's located in the middle of the frat-party wasteland known as Turtle Bay, but the creative Thai-inflected Vietnamese place is solid and the service is fairly decent.  Clearly Michael Hyunh knows how to deliver consistency to the NYC crowd.  The ambience is surprisingly sleek and sexy for the 'hood.  Standouts include the Calamari app, the Pork Belly side, yellow curry entree and their creative takes on the Bun (cold vermicelli salad), particularly the pork/shrimp and the veggie/tofu ones.  I have not tried the pho, since it sounds like the pho is the weakest link based on the other reviews.  I was surprised at how consistently empty the place is on Friday nights, but I hope business picks up for them.",Kayo N.,"Brooklyn, NY",7/30/2010,4.0

"Good food, reasonably priced, cute atmosphere. What's not to like? I especially liked the fake plastic grass on one wall. (they made it work)

They also have a fun cocktail menu.

Service was good; our food came lightening fast after we ordered. The noodles I got (with chicken) were excellent...hot, fresh, flavorful, chewy goodness. My date got the salt and pepper shrimp which were also tasty, but just want to note the shrimp still had their shell/skin which we didn't expect.

2 drinks + 2 entrees for a little over $50 with tip - not bad; especially since there are leftovers!",Karen C.,"New York, NY",8/28/2010,4.0
"Wow, I'm shocked from these reviews!

I've been to Obao probably once a week for the past 6 months and sporadically before that - it's my favorite food/drinks place. My colleagues and I walk over from 30 Rock to grab a few and get great food.

I can't speak about the cocktails or the shot specials but the food and the beer are legit. Having been there so many times, I have tried most of their menu. Their beer specials are two dollars (draft) and a bucket of five for 20 bucks (bottled). I also can't speak for delivery because I usually sit down at the place. The quality is great, the quantity is great and they get it to you in a timely manner. My favorites are the Pad Thai, the Fried Rice(s) (they have two, one that's Pork Chop and one that's Shrimp Pineapple), sticky rice, the dumplins and the chicken wings.

If you're a little skeptical because of some of the reviews or you haven't tried Asian food in general, I suggest you check the place out during happy hour - they have specials on drinks, appetizers and an early bird special (appetizer and entr√©e for 10 bucks.)

You'll be a believer, I guarantee it.",Brian L.,"Manhattan, NY",10/26/2012,5.0
"Great specials all week, delicious fresh food, friendly staff.

Love this place!  Great mix of Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese dishes.  My boyfriend and I end up going here almost every week.  The place is much bigger than it appears from the outside, and while we're fans of the fake green grass lining the wall in the front and front corner booth, we usually choose to sit in the back dining room, which is cozier- they also have nice long benches for big groups to sit at.

Our favorite dish, by far, is the claypot catfish, which is absolutely delicious and just the right sized portion- though they vary on the amount of bok choy included, which can be frustrating because I love a lot of veggies.

My favorites: Fresh Shrimp Rolls, Sauteed Chinese Broccoli side dish, Daikon Cake Wok Noodles.  Pad See Iew is also very good.

Almost every night features a drink special from ladies night with $5 cocktails to 1/2 wine on Sundays and a Buy 3 appetizer/drink combo.",Patricia C.,"New York, NY",3/27/2011,5.0

"~75 minutes after placing my delivery order via Yelp/delivery.com, I decide to call in and see where my order is at. No answer, phone just rings and rings. Did that a few times thinking they are just super busy, letting the phone ring for about 10 minutes total. No answer. Called delivery.com and they couldn't get through either. Had to cancel my order with delivery.com support and seek other options. I'll be really lucky if I get food in me within 2 hours of starting this whole process. Supremely disappointed in Obao, was super looking forward to trying their cuisine but I guess the lack of their ability to maintain their business hours is just too much for them to handle. After getting another food order in I tried calling their Hell's Kitchen location to see if there was a manager I could yell at or something, but they weren't picking up the phone either. Probably a good idea not to take my call, I've got a hangry aura of hate floating around me right now and it would not have been pretty.",Jesten T.,"Santa Monica, CA",12/15/2014,1.0
"This place gets a 4 for the food, but a 2 for the service.

I came here for a friend's birthday dinner, and we had a table reserved. The outside is pretty unassuming; you take a peek inside and there appears to just be a couple of tables and a bar. However, if you take a step through the walkway, you'll come to the realization that there are some benches and long wooden tables in the back. I'm not a fan of hard, wooden benches as a seating option outside of a school setting, but the low lighting and simple decor helped cope with that.

We were seated near the rear, right by the outdoor seating area, which was now of course closed off for winter. There are also quite a few skylights. All this glass made for a chilly dining experience.

Anyway, first up, the 2-star service. Our waiter came and was very friendly. If only he had more to work with! You see, they were out of a couple items when we ordered. The place closes at 10:30, so to have a food shortage at 7-7:30 is ridiculous, in my opinion. I originally wanted one of the vermicelli noodle dishes, but they only had one order, and my friend got that. Another person wanted the spicy Bangkok chicken, and they were out of that. Our waiter was apologetic and waited as we tried to find alternate items. I chose the pad see ew, which was really delicious...too bad I had to wait a long time to get it.

I watched as everyone's dishes arrived at their tables. After everyone was served and eating, I looked down at my barren section of table and wondered, ""where is my pad see ew?"" Someone else at the table had ordered the same thing, and was ready to munch, so where was mine? When we asked the waiter, he was helpful and went back to check. A few moments later he placed the food on my table and nonchalantly said ""Oh, it was just sitting there."" with a chuckle, and trotted off.

It was just sitting there? Really? Thankfully not much time had passed and the food was still delightfully hot, and tasty, but I was annoyed that I had to wait while my food ""just sat there"" waiting to be brought out.

I was glad that the food was tasty after the wait, but still annoyed that the wait happened in the first place.

I'm sure the others in my party would rate this much better, but me? The overall experience was just OK. Not ""A-OK"", just ""OK"".",DeShaun C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1/25/2010,3.0
"I went here a couple of weeks after opening and they clearly were having some opening issues.

The food: Serviceable melange of currently 'hot' east asian food. You'll find pho, pork belly, spring rolls, etc. This table of 3 split a cornucopia of dishes and came away unimpressed with most. The pho lacked that punchy, deep, musky fill your soup with the richness that can only come from beef bones sensation. The pork belly was flavored alright, but was tough (overcooked?) and chewy. The best thing we had was the duck confit rice; it was richly flavored with duck fat and a nice mix of confited duck meat.

Service: Needs improvement. I think we were served by a total of 3 different waiters during our dinner and none of them talked to each other.

Location: A place serving food like this, at a price point like this (affordable) should be great asset like this in a neighborhood lacking in great food options. However, it's got a ways to go before it starts registering in people's heads as a dining destination.",John Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",12/22/2009,3.0
"Ordered the shrimp and bamboo shoots and requested to add cashew nuts (needed to satisfy a craving), which would've added a whopping $2 onto the $10 entree.  Ended up receiving chicken and cashew nuts.  Hm.  I didn't mind too much, because I was in a dilemma between choosing that dish and the one I ordered anyway.  Unfortunately, the dish wasn't that good -- it was very soy sauce heavy, and I was hoping for something a little more interesting on a dish when it was charging $10 for lunch.  I would've been much happier at a standard American Chinese eatery, which would have cooked the chicken more flavorfully, and be $5 richer.  

Looking at the other responses, it seems like I made a poor choice in getting a standard Chinese dish instead of the noodles -- I went with a friend who ordered some herself, and she left the restaurant happy.  I probably will go back to give it another try -- after all, despite the order flub, the service was amicable, and the place has a pretty cool decor -- room with fake grass as wallpaper in the front, a darker back room with a Japanese izakaya-feel, and a sunroom in the very back.",M H.,"New York, NY",8/7/2010,2.0
"I really liked this play and would definitely go back. They have a Happy Hour that includes all Sunday through Weds where the drinks are 5$ and Saporro is only 2$. The drinks sound better on the menu than they taste, but hey, 5 bucks in Manhattan is hard to beat.

The food was quite tasty from chicken to short rib to tofu. All was pretty decent. Rice was maybe a tad over cooked (steamed), nonehteless all was pretty solid.

Service was excellent. Ask for TK when you're there and you'll surely be treated well and enjoy your experience!",Matt W.,"Palm Springs, CA",12/3/2012,4.0

"Came here for lunch with a co-worker yesterday, off a whim, no plan. We waited about 10 minutes, which was well worth it. The place is small and very busy, but we got lucky to get one of the high tables where you can have a conversation without the sable next to you being forced to hear it. The food was great and not expensive at all (two apps, two entrees and two drinks w/tip was about $50). I'd highly recommend going to Oboa and I will definitely be back to taste some of the other items on the menu. Try the papaya salad!",Don L.,"New York, NY",5/10/2013,4.0
"Let me start by saying I wish Yelp allowed for half stars as 3 is too little and 4 too much. That being said...

This place was pretty decent for Midtown vietnamese inda food. Granted they have a waffle house menu trying t o have isan, and thai as well. The decore in the back room was tables on the sides wiht ling shaired benches in the middle, food was decent, and it seems they have happy house as well.

I have to admit that the noodles were way to over soaked and the flavor was tame and made for midtown locals, but I also have to admit it is a place you could take your GF's parent from texas and not freak them out.

Given the opportunity id rather go to chinatown and get a dirtier more tastier and more authentic version but not bad for midtown.

i will likely be back.",Christoff F.,"New York, NY",9/1/2010,3.0

"The flavors of Thailand and Vietnam are not well represented.  Everything I had was limp and bland.  The papaya salad was tired -- no crunch, no zing of vinegar, absolutely no hint of heat from a chili.  The coconut rice had no coconut and no sweetness.  The atmosphere was small, dark and noisy.  The wait staff looked panicked and aren't very friendly.  There are so many better restaurants, I'd skip this one.",V. E.,"Los Angeles, CA",7/21/2015,2.0
"I loveeeee Obao. I always take all my friends here for cheap and good thai food. Great wok dishes-- strongly recommend the pad kee mao. DELISH!

Why not give it a 5, you ask? Well, today I decided to try beef in my pad kee mao instead of my usual pork/chicken/tofu and it was pretty dry and chewy. Disappointed? Yes, but not enough to stop me from going back and singing it's praises from the proverbial rooftops of Yelp.",Priyanka M.,"New York, NY",8/22/2010,4.0

"if you're gonna serve thai iced tea, it should be good.  i think after my first sip of my drink, this place was downhill for me.

the only good dish here seemed to be the stonepot catfish that my cousin got.  the laos beef salad and vegetable spring rolls that i got were just ok.

"After having read a few reviews, I was really looking forward to trying this place out, and finally had the opportunity to do so last weekend. I've had a lot of really good vietnamese food and I have to admit that I was somewhat dissapointed by OBao.

As other people have pointed out, the pork belly skewers (which I was really looking forward to) were hard as a rock and the skin was gelatinous and tough. I was thoroughly dissapointed in them. Good pork belly should be soft and tender and should basically fall apart once you touch it, and this was what I was expecting, but sadly I was mistaken, and this may have set the tone for the rest of the meal.

The pho wasn't bad, it was pretty standard and a decent size with a flavorful broth. There was nothing particularly stunning about it, but it did the job. I do note that it doesn't have the tendon or tripe normally found in pho, but that may just be to cater to American tastes.

The other dish I tried, the pad see ew, was actually quite decent, although somewhat small. It was served with kalbi short rib, which was tender and sweet and played well with the noodles. It was definitely the highlight of the meal, but I wouldn't say it was amazing.

All in all, a decent place with decent prices, just stay away from the pork skewers and you'll be fine. Also note that it is cash only.",Tim S.,"New York, NY",12/10/2009,3.0
"Ordered take out - Pad Thai & a Shrimp & Pork vermacelli with a side of sticky rice w/sausage and chicken.  Flavors were delicious and the portions were substantial.

"Just got back from lunch with a friend at Obao. I was overall disappointed. The lunch special is not so special after all. The chef's choice free appetizer was bad. I don't even know what it was to be honest. Bones with some meat on them with no flavor. The entree was pretty good, chicken see iew (extra spicy), and a good portion size. The service was HORRENDOUS. Only saw our server twice - once when she was taking our order, and once when she was giving us our check (which we didn't even ask for). There was another waiter near us who literally broke 3 things in the short time span that we were there. I'm assuming he's new. But overall, the ambience was pretty decent, food alright, and the service...needs work.",Christine L.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",5/31/2012,3.0
"Although we missed the early dinner special deal, I'm still a huge fan of OBao (and we were able to get $2 Sapporo beers). We had the spareribs on sugarcane skewers to start, which came out with 5 pieces. Then, I had the Spicy Bangkok Chicken, which was only mildly spicy but delicious nonetheless. Other dishes ordered were the Pad Thai (with tofu instead of shrimp) and the Chicken on Vermicelli noodles, both of which received great reviews. The last dish, the Pho Bowl was kind of flavorless. I definitely want to go back and try the rest of the menu - hopefully for the early dinner deal!",Rachel A.,"San Francisco, CA",5/18/2012,4.0
"I have not actually eaten INSIDE the restaurant, but I have ordered from here many times.  That said, my review is geared to those who are thinking about a DELIVERY option from Obao.

I order a couple of items - the crispy pork belly, pho bao, spring rolls, pork chop, pad thai, and pineapple fried rice - and I have to say that all are pretty good if you want them delivered.  I was most afraid of how the crispy pork would hold up (it was still crispy and moist on the inside) and the pho (noodles were separated from the broth on delivery).

My one complaint with the pho, however, is that the meat is already in the broth so it is not as rare as I usually like.  That said, this is probably the best pho I have been able to find in Midtown East (that delivers).

"A nice little spot in midtown with a very tasty fusion menu. I had their crispy pork belly which was very soft of tender.. not hard at all despite what others said. For entree I had the Singapore Laksa noodle soup, had a flavorful spicy soup that reminded me of thai curry but the noodles were a little too soft, not sure if that's the way how it suppose to be, overall it was kinda like a fused ramen.. My partner had their delicious Pad See Iew, a bit salty and oily but still a pretty good dish.
We topped it all off with a glass of Thai iced tea that was also well made. Clean dining area, friendly staff and quick service. However i do recommend sitting in the back because it can be noisy in the front from the people comin and going from the bar next door when Obao has their doors opened.",Dreyfus W.,"New York, NY",6/14/2010,4.0
I went back last night for dinner.  $5 cocktails just made me so happy and are worthy of at least 4 starts.  I tried my favorite Thai dish - prig khing - it was one of the best prig king I tried in NYC and greatly exceeded my expectations.  Spare rib on sugar cane for appetizer was also delicious.  I love this place.,Akira O.,"New York, NY",9/1/2011,4.0
Very good! A typical Southeast Asian fusion restaurant. Tried the S'pore laksa (i have to admit I'm a noodle soup person here) the first time I visited here. The taste of the soup and texture of the noodles are very satisfying. And the price is also pretty reasonable compared to the quality of their food. The only unpleasant part is the 15$ minimum for credit card charge.,Yan D.,"San Francisco, CA",11/26/2011,4.0
"I was pleasantly surprised.  It's a nice little asian fusion restaurant in midtown east. The dining room was cozy/intimate, but casual.  My date and I tried the vietnamese chicken salad, the pad see iew, and steamed fish.  Good service and decent prices.  Nice date spot if you're planning dinner and a movie or something casual.",R G.,"Danbury, CT",10/21/2012,4.0
"My second trip to Obao was just as underwhelming. Again the free appetizer was pork with no vegetarian option. I had the pineapple fried rice with shrimp. It was very bland, hardly any pineapple or shrimp. Overall, very blah. There are many great thai options in the city, skip this place.",Luz M.,"Yonkers, NY",4/9/2012,2.0
"if you find yourself stuck in midtown east and are dying to dive face first into a bowl of pho.. come to obao (not just because it's your only option) they only offer the pho bo on the menu, but they will always substitute chicken or veggies if you ask! not authentic vietnamese, but it does the trick if you need a pho fix in midtown east!",Amie R.,"Manhattan, NY",4/28/2014,3.0
"First of all, great atmosphere.  On a hot summer's day, we were asked whether we were ""enjoying the weather"" and wanted to sit out the front, or whether we would prefer the air conditioned coolness of the rear.  Without hesitation, we opted for the latter.  The back room is great, the building is actually single storey back there and there are numerous skylights (which occasionally had a few pigeons sitting on them, which is an odd angle to view a pigeon) and there is even a small courtyard.  Since it was a lazy Sunday afternoon, the place was pretty much empty and we were the only two out back.  And the music was right up my alley, alternative tunes all the way.

Anyway, after a couple of crispy spring rolls, we had the vermicelli with tofu and veggies and the Daikan cake noodle dished.  The daikan was a bit greasy, but the vermicelli were just perfect - very light and refreshing.

A great discovery right on my block!",Adam F.,"New York, NY",7/18/2010,3.0
"Fantastic food, reasonable prices for the area, humble courteous staff. ..go here!",Chi J.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/26/2012,5.0
"I came here for a friend's birthday this last weekend, and while I wouldn't head out of my way to eat here, I'd still be happy returning. The waiters were very accommodating and agreed to hold onto our party's homemade birthday cake in the kitchen until we finished our meals. They were even nice enough to provide the birthday girl with birthday candles.
We were seated in the space toward the back, where the tables were not as densely packed as most New York restaurants are, something I would definitely appreciate if I were eating with a smaller party. It looks like they're adding an outdoor dining table in the back, but as of now, it's still in a very rudimentary stage.

Focusing on the food, I got the Pad see iew, a flat-noodle dish mixed with slightly sweet brown sauce and very flavorful pork kalbi.  Went great with Sriracha sauce! I also tried the tom yum, which was a bit on the salty side, but good and plenty sour (as tom yums should be). The Chiang Mai broth was savory, although also just a tad too salty upon first taste. However, I came to appreciate the salt when I realized it brought out the flavor of the beef chunks nicely. Overall, food was great although not quite to the point where I was gushing about it. Due to generous portion sizes, you will either walk away from Obao feeling super stuffed or carrying a ton of leftovers. Or both!",Tina T.,"New York, NY",5/26/2010,4.0
"I love this place and come here on a weekly basis.  I live around the area and it's a shame that 2nd is filled with bars and restaurants but there aren't many good Asian places near.  Obao is delicious!  I love their pho bo (better than most!!) and the spareribs with sugar cane.  The pork belly is also delicious along with the salt and pepper shrimp.  The staff is extremely friendly and courteous.  A hidden gem in midtown.

In addition, a meal at Obao is less than chipotle!",Cary L.,"Manhattan, NY",3/13/2013,4.0
"I wanted to treat myself to a delicious birthday lunch, so I called to place an order of chiang mai noodles for pick-up. When I arrived an hour after I called my order was still not ready. I had to wait an additional 30 minutes, standing awkwardly to the side in a crowded space. They pretended that I didn't notice them just then remembering to give my order to the kitchen. None of the staff were helpful or apologetic for having me wait so long. Super frustrating! By the time I actually ate lunch I was too hungry to notice if it was all worth the wait.",Maria C.,"Brooklyn, NY",3/12/2015,1.0

"Excellent food, good service. I live across the street, and this place is my go-to Thai/Vietnamese place on my block.  There is at least one other establishment that serves similar fare (Rain), but does not compare in quality of food or just general deliciousness.

Where to start, I am not a fan of soups, but their Pho Bo is Michelin recommended, and my girl's favorite.  I have enjoyed their Paad Thai a few too many times, and now am a bit bored by it, so I have switched to the paad si eiw (sp?). Quite excellent.  Their BBQ is probably the best on the menu, and you really cant go wrong with the pork chop or the chicken, but their Kalbi separates itself from the others.  I have also enjoyed their curries, Curry Bo for example is quite good, as is the Prawn Prik, but I wasnt bowled over.  Of their apps, I have enjoyed the Michelin recommended Spare Rib on Sugarcane, crispy spring roll and Japanese eggplant.  Their summer roll is just OK.  Theyre Thai Iced Tea is also quite delicious and refreshing.  Add to that, during ""happy hour"" till 7pm on weekdays I believe, and all day on weekends they serve $2 Sapporo Drafts.  Overall, this is an excellent place, and I would highly recommend it for eat-in or take out.",Kaushik R.,"New York, NY",4/5/2012,4.0
"Sitting here right now. Sad sad pour of wine.  Sloooooow service and food is nothing special (yet). There's a fly circling me now, maybe that impacted their pending grade. Omg got my food, so bad I had to return it. Wow. Clearly targeting theater crowd and not aiming for repeat attendance. If you live in nyc, go to Pur Noodle, Gazala, Afghan Kabob or Medi wine Bar all near by and delicious.",Voca A.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",6/26/2014,1.0
"I work and live pretty much next door and I have been waiting a year for somebody to open a decent Vietnamese restaurant in this area.  Thank you Michael Huynh!  Though I would have loved to see some banh mi on the menu, what OBao does provide is the best bowl of pho in the midtown area (east or west).  Other great choices are the Pad See Iew, all the rice dishes, the crispy spring rolls, crispy pork belly, and spare rib on sugar cane.  The only thing I would strongly recommend against is the spicy beef salad, it is very far from traditional and I found the combination of pineapple, sour grapefruit, spicy beef and mint did not make sense to my tongue.  

The restaurant itself is still working out some kinks (they have temperature issues in the dining area during lunch) and still doesn't have a liquor license.  It's also a bit on the pricey side for a workday lunch, but well worth it when the craving hits.

***EDIT, July 2010: I have noticed that their take out Pho is becoming sloppier and sloppier.  They overcook the meat when it is bought in delivery form and the noodles tend to be cold and hardened.  I suggest NOT ordering their Pho for delivery, Golden City's is actually better and they deliver in almost the same area.",Sue L.,"New York, NY",2/3/2010,3.0
"I go out to eat often and this place was, without hesitation, the worst place I have been to in a long time. The service was awful, as was the food. Not once did the wait staff come to our table. We constantly had to call them over so we could get water, order, get forks, get more water, a glass for the beer, get the check etc. And the place was fairly empty. We ordered two salads (basic thai salad and a chicken salad) and steamed dumplings. The chicken salad was so bad - the chicken was pieces of bone, fat and skin and it was soaked in a nasty tasting dressing. The basic salad on the other hand had a good dressing but the salad was mostly sprouts and not much else. The dumplings were so so.  I would give this place a 0 if Yelp allowed it, as it was truly awful.",jill w.,"New York, NY",8/30/2013,1.0
"Out of my usual dining radius because I'm at a client location, so I took the opportunity to be adventurous and explore in the 50's st.'s east of 6th avenue.

I asked around and received a recommendation on thai. ""Best dumplings I've ever had."" OK! Ordering the dumplings.... and the crispy lettuce wrapped spring rolls. The thought to order the chicken bangkok style crossed my mind, but I figured I was getting carried away. Didn't know what I was dealing with yet, so I left that for next time.

There is no next time, unfortunately.

My co-worker and I placed phone orders literally 30 seconds apart. Her first, then me. Same address, same floor. Her's arrives at 12:20pm 'ish. Cold on arrival. ""Eat, its getting cold!"" No matter, its already destined for the office micro.

12:30pm, 12:45pm, no food for me! I call, and I am rushed off the phone hastily after being informed it's on its way.

12:55pm, cold on arrival. Wasn't expecting it to be piping hot, but not refrigerator temperature, either. The delivery distance was 2 streets and 2 avenues.

After nuking the overpriced, skimpy portions, and diving in, (the dumplings were actually tasty), I was hit with the realization that something in these two dishes was causing an allergic reaction. Skin getting hot, mouth salivating, throat itchy... oh no.

I have no known food allergies, mind you, which makes me concerned about the place's cleanliness.

Star Breakdown:

Tasty dumplings = 1/2 star
Actually getting the food = 1/2 star

Dining inside might be a better experience; but that might just be my optimism talking.

Never again.",Jonathan B.,"Manhattan, NY",1/24/2013,1.0
"I got the pad kee mao and grilled japanese eggplant. Thank god I got take-out because the place was packed at lunchtime! The pad kee mao was really delicious--spicy but not too spicy. The eggplant appetizer was good, but it was swimming in some kind of oily fluid in the container, which might have been just excess fluid from the eggplant?? Still, I'd definitely come back.",Rachel V.,"Manhattan, NY",7/16/2012,4.0
"Only been here 2x. Would need to go more often for a full 5 stars. But so far, the food and service has been consistently good.

The staff is friendly and helpful. They do their job but don't make you feel rushed or hover over you, so you can enjoy your meal in peace.

The food is good, tasty, and very reasonably priced. In this part of the city, down the block, a pizza slice can cost $3 - for a regular pepperoni. The average dishes here are about $10, very reasonable. And the food is filling, leaving you satisfied, filled, but doesn't sit heavy. Excellent value!",A K.,"Atlanta, GA",10/3/2012,4.0

"I always stop for a moment when I am writing my reviews. Sometimes I feel like I am just being nice by giving more than 3 stars to restaurant. In the case of OBao, it teeters on the edge. Not because of anything I experienced while there but because I have come to expect a restaurant to be better than average. It is modern business to exceed expectations. We all work in some industry and today, ""exceeding expectations"" is the norm. So, I had a great meal. The selection, flavors and presentation were all there. The only thing that was average for me was the service. It was relaxed not bad. The staff was busy. Every business is cutting costs these days so no one was just standing around. When we needed something we just had to gesture to our server and they came right over. It was what I expected and they delivered but does that ring out 4 or 5 stars? Only you can decide on that review but we did enjoy ourselves and so my 4 stars will prevail.",Stephen C.,"New York, NY",4/13/2013,4.0
"I had given up on ever finding real Vietnamese noodles in Midtown. But on this day, I didn't have time to take the family Downtown for pho, so I decided to give Obao a try based on good recommendations on Yelp. I had heard of it before, but never wanted to try. I try to stay away from restaurants that claim to be Asian ""fusion"", because it usually means they serve mediocre fare that bears no resemblance to anything in Asia.  Besides, what kind of a Vietnamese place is called ""Obao"". What does that mean, anyway? It turns out that it is not just Vietnamese, but offers a combination of dishes from all over Southeast Asia. Long story short, the pho was good! It wasn't intense, like pho you would get on the street in Vietnam, but that's probably because Obao doesn't use as much MSG as they do in Vietnam. But the broth was clear and all the beefy flavors were there. It even came with the requisite bean sprouts, lime and Thai basil leaves (although I would have liked more of these garnishes). My daughter had bun bo hue, which was, like the pho, not intense but very correct and...authentic! It was the same with the Vietnamese chicken salad with fish sauce dressing, which had the vital Vietnamese coriander.  All in all, I was very impressed and am anxious to go back to try their other Vietnamese offerings. The venue was small with tasteful decor. The service was professional and efficient, if not overly friendly.",Tony D.,"Geneva, Switzerland",5/27/2013,4.0
"YUM. I was impressed with the great ratings the restaurant got so I anxiously awaited to try out a new Asian restaurant. I know you can never go wrong with Thai food takeout, but this will entice you to want to order from them again on a rainy Saturday night (for me at least). We got the:
Steam Dumplings - delicious chicken and shrimp combo with a nice kick w/ the chili soy sauce
Crispy Pork Belly - delicious with the gaze
Tom Yum Seafood Soup - spicy enough to complement the other dishes
Pork Chop Fried Rice - The large slap of beef on top made it difficult to eat. This dish was recommended by one of the workers, and it definitely lived up to the rec, but I just wish the meat was cut up into the dish. The last thing i want to do is work at my food.
Pad See Iew - it was nice that there were pieces of kimchi in here. You can't go too wrong with this dish. A safe and reliable order.
I wouldn't order the lettuce spring roll wraps - it's basically just spring rolls with a few lettuce leaves in it.  Nothing phenomenal. A little pricy for what it is but definitely worth ordering from again!",Jane R.,"New York, NY",11/9/2011,4.0

"Came here for a dinner with a friend who highly recommended this place.  
Just like some earlier reviews mentioned, while I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at this restaurant, the service was good and I definitely wouldn't mind returning.

Now to the food. We got the Singapore Laksa and the Hand-cut Daikon cake (with extra egg and chilli), along with a jackfruit shake. First off, kudos to the chef for its somewhat diverse and exotic menu. The food though, was slightly above average. The Singapore Laksa was tasty, smooth and fragrant. The Daikon cake was good, but I found it a little too sweet. The jackfruit shake was refreshing but definitely had a bit too much ice in it.

"I had Pho Bo, dumplings, and coffee delivered from OBao via Seamless to a location 3 blocks away. The reviews here make me think this is a nice place to go to, but I wouldn't recommend them for delivery.

Slow delivery: I was only 3 blocks away. Seamless told me it would take 30-40 minutes to arrive--but took over an hour for the food to come. Hmm.

Poor packaging: The hot Vietnamese coffee I ordered was put in the tiniest paper cup, so of course half the coffee had spilled out and leaked all over the food by the time I got my delivery. My noodles and veggies were in paper containers that were thoroughly soaked with coffee--ew! And what coffee was left was pretty cold. I feel cheated. (Protip: Pack your drinks in slightly larger containers so that the liquid won't immediately splash out with every bump on the delivery bike. That's what most restaurants do!)

Food: Due to the slow delivery, my noodles had congealed into one cold mass by the time I got to eat them. I had to cut the noodle block apart with a knife and a fork to get it down into manageable, gooey chunks. Tasted fine, but I was hoping to have noodles and not gelatinous dumplings in my pho.

Otherwise, the food tasted decent, though the lettuce wasn't the freshest. Not sure I'll be ordering from here again.",Pho N.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",1/22/2012,2.0
"What happen to this place????! It used to be one of my favorite neighborhood place that I would go out to eat or order in. Last time I visited here, their menu changed, (sign of uh-oh, hope it is still good?) price got higher, food in smaller portion, service still horrible (yes they never really had good service)  and then the food test! Yuck! They are pre-making summer roll and REFRIGERATE them which is complete no no, and they serve those hard not possible to chew summer roll. They used to have such a good summer roll and more.  Not only the appetizers but all main entree that we ordered were not good nor did it taste the same. They have lost their touch. Very disappointed. I used to take every single friend of mine and even my clients. Unfortunately,  last time I was there it was with my client who wanted to try something different than just fancy restaurant but that experience was bad. All waitress were wearing a skimpy clothes plus their English wasn't good, I took them to a restaurant not a .... l! I don't even mind the price raise if they deliver at least same quality of food but it almost taste like the've got new kitchen staff and more. Guess I have to find another place to go.

Service: excellent, quick, and he picked up on the fact that he didnt put any chinese sausage in my dish and quickly brought me a side order of it. Very willing to switch out meats for something else.

so 2 weeks later i gave this place another try and this time brought up the refill tea question prior to ordering and found out she was wrong i could have gotten a refill if i like... the second time i'm there... the experience was ok... the Pho was ok, not great and the tea was low grade tea that will go right through the filter into your cup ... you will be drinking tea w/tea crumbs... :( This place is ok but there are better out there...",Patrice P.,"Manhattan, NY",3/12/2012,2.0

"Good restaurant for casual dinner. Went there on the hottest day in New York and the AC in the car was broken. They managed to get a unit and had it up and running soon though. Got seating immediately though was offered seating in the communal long bench seating only when we asked for it. Service was not very prompt to take orders, but there wasn't too much of a wait for the food to be served.
Food : Tasty but not excitingly different. The Crispy Tofu appetizer was bland and dry. The Vegetarian Spring Rolls had flavor, but again, nothing very different from any other Asian restaurant. Ordered the Kua Gai Entr√©e which was basically chicken with flat noodles and vegetables, which was delicious. Other dishes we ordered were the Pad Kha Praw Entr√©e and the Puk Fried Rice Entr√©e. These too were very scrumptious, but arrived slightly cold on arrival.
Service : Was slow initially to take orders/serve water, but did not have to wait for long for the food to arrive. Was difficult catching the attention of the waitress who was serving us.
Ambiance : Simple, quite, relaxed ambiance. Good for a weekday after-work dinner, not suited if you want something exotic or a different experience.",Ninad G.,"Brooklyn, NY",7/23/2011,3.0
"1)   First off, service was FANTASTIC.  It was as if the waittress was reading our minds.  Speedy and efficient!  
2)   The appetizer (vegetable spring rolls) was ok.  Unfortunately the wrapper was far too dense and took over the taste, or lack thereof.
2)   The entree however, was not as appealing as I had hoped, but perhaps I was just craving something different.  I was in the mood for noodles! I got the chicken marinated vermicelli......very disappointing.  It amounted to bland vermicelli on top of bland romaine with some yummy sliced chicken on top. Although a few pieces of the chicken were inedible... (cartilage? no thank you!)  
3)   My boyfriend's dish on the other hand, was amazing.  He ordered the Pad Kha Praw Entr√©e and it was fresh and oh-so-addictive and tasty.  
4) IN ALL, I give 3 stars for impeccable service and ok food.  I would go again but I would most definitely order something different.",Rebecca B.,"Manhattan, NY",10/18/2011,3.0

I've enjoyed everything I've tried here so far: The Singapore Laksa is a delicious, fragrant coconut curry soup with shrimp, pork and buck wheat noodles. The Singapore Noodles have tasty Chinese sausage, shrimp, bean sprouts and fresh chives. They also make delicious Pad Thai, served with lots of shrimp and an almost-poached egg cracked on top. I've had pad thai with bits of cooked egg in it, but poached is far more flavorful, as the egg joins the rest of the sauce and adds serious richness to it. The Laos Beef Salad is tasty too, if a bit small. It's chilled, with grilled short rib, pineapple, mint, cucumber and roasted rice in a light lime dressing. Perfect if you're looking for a lighter meal or an appetizer.",Krista K.,"Dunedin, FL",9/5/2010,4.0
"Came here for my birthday lunch with my colleagues. All 7 people were happy with their delicious meals and the service (they did get my order wrong and I was the last person served but no hard feelings...it happens). Try the thai iced tea. From the look of it, I thought it was carrot juice at first. But, it tastes like tea & milk. It's quite tasty.

I recommend sitting out in the sun room or in one of the booths.",Adeola A.,"Manhattan, NY",5/27/2011,4.0
"Yay! My 3rd post and the 3rd for Obao! oboy! I have the great fortune of working across the street from Obao. Ran over for a nice lunchtime treat. Being new to NYC, I haven't been to one of the 500 MH restaurant establishments yet, so this was my first. A de-virginization if you will. I was a bit hesitant after reading so much flack about his kingdom and wondered whether the food would be great or merely a step above a Yoshinoya Beef Bowl. My prayers were answered with the crispy pork belly (with a lovely marinade) and savory Singapore Noodles. Both a steal at $9 each. (Yes, I'm Asian and I know a bargain when I see one.) The only minor hiccup came at the end, when trying to get change. But all in all, a good experience :)  My waitress was very friendly and I left very pleased. Will definitely return to try their duck confit fried rice...mmmm!",Lilly M.,"Manhattan, NY",11/25/2009,4.0
"Way overpriced lunch. Confused staff had to be flagged down to bring us our drinks 20 minutes later. It is a nice touch to provide free crab app at the beginning. No one came back to ask if we needed anything and we had to beg for our check.

Great decor- AstroTurf on the walls, cozy wooden benches and booths in the back.

"i wish i can write more with what i had in my mind but i am out of time at this time and would certainly update/edit in later time. i promise to review this place right away. this used to be bunchberries and perfectly in placed is now a vietnemese restaurant - a rare find in midtown east. so i'm glad because this is a walk and conveniently located. i ordered pho bo - a popular vietnemese dish. it comes with rare beef brisket, rice noodles and others but with a small cup of bean sprouts (huh, maybe, they can add more or you can ask more if you like). i rarely order rare in beef. i was not crazy about the beef because it's kinda hard to chew. but shawn, i guess the manager was nice enough to ask me how it was and i politely suggested maybe, if the beef were sliced thinly they are going to be more tender. the staff were friendly and really catering. they want to do their best for customers. but for the price of $9 a bowl, i think the starting price is a little bit high.

continuing, because this is a new restaurant, management appreciates to hear opinions for improvement. from the lovely, attentive management, my meal came with complimentary crispy banana mixed with nut in thin wrap, drizzled with caramel and white sugar powder. this is not in the menu but they can make it for you if you wish to have it. i suggested that since it has nuts already inside the wrap that to replace the sugary pecans side with vanilla ice cream or add it with it. and presto, a perfect delicious dessert that can be added to the menu. i would like to have the garlic spinach but i know a small pho is just enough to fill you up. i thought $6 for this dish is good but i don't know what's the portion size for this price. it also serves pad thai at $11 (since the manager is a thai). it would be interesting to try it . in addition, the grilled eggplant w/ dried shrimp paste @ $9 and lamb satay $9 for apps might be good too. is this mean i have to come back? we'll see.",Ma-e M.,"Baltimore, MD",12/12/2009,3.0

also had the viet fried rice (yum...) & spicy bangkok chicken (moist, but just ok.. disclaimer: i rarely like chicken very much unless it's rotisserie or fried)

3 times in one week. beat that.

note: i just realized that i may have received the thai fried rice, not viet, and upon inspecting the menu, im pretty sure that's accurate, so a correction - THAI fried rice, yum.",Justine H.,"New York, NY",11/23/2009,4.0
"I was pleasantly surprised by the crisp-skinned, tender sliced chicken breast over my vermicelli. The dish was adequate, but would have been so so so much better with the addition of herbs, particularly basil. Chicken, rice noodles, and cucumber with nuoc cham can be brought to another level with some herbs, which is why it broke my chowhound heart that they hadn't been included, because the other elements were in place!! I asked for chili paste and was granted sriracha, but on the way out I noticed some chili oil that looked quite promising. Ask for that if you're a pepperhead! The prices are too high. The decor and ambience are swell. We easily got a large table for 6, and could hear each other perfectly, the restaurant being near-empty.",Kelly M.,"New York, NY",1/22/2011,3.0

"Went here for lunch and ordered a Tom Yum seafood soup, rice noodles with mushrooms and tofu skin and a vegetable pho. The tom yum was great and large but the rest was so so. The sauce with the rice noodle was just a diluted soy sauce and the pho had way too much lemon grass.

"Absolutely delicious! This is the kind of place that is great for groups... because there is SO much on the menu that sounds amazing. To start we shared the crispy spring rolls, pork belly and Thai salad. For our main courses we got shrimp pad thai, shrimp clay pot and crispy fish. The flavors were authentic and the portions were perfect. The wait staff was friendly, gave great suggestions and allowed us to enjoy a leisurely meal.

"I had lunch at Obao on the recommendation of a coworker. At first I was looking for Thai, but Obao appears to have a pan-Southeast Asian menu (which works for me). It was takeout so I can only comment on the one dish that I had. The atmosphere looked nice when I picked up my food, but it was pretty expensive for lunch considering there was no price difference to have the dish vegetarian as I did or with meat. I got Pad Kee Mao (choice of chicken, pork, beef, shrimp, or tofu flat rice noodles, egg, tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, basil, w/ chili basil sauce) and it was definitely good. I will most likely go to Obao again. I would have given it four stars except for the price.",Seth H.,"Orlando, FL",8/24/2010,3.0
"Went there for lunch on a sunday and only good thing about this place was the seating area. They wouldn't let us even settle down before wanting our orders and once we had ordered the appetizers and drinks, they came back in like 2 mins for the main course.

"Came in after getting most of Columbus Day Off.  $2 Sapporo Mugs and a $10 appetizer  + entree deal .  Service was fast and the food (roast pork w Chinese brocoli) was not only good, but plentiful and artfully presented.  Very surprised in this neighborhood at this price point.  Two people w two beers each was under $40 with tax and a generous tip.  I guess that is why the place was getting busy despite it being a cold Monday.   The $10 deal is through 6:30 meaning that those of us who actually work in NYC rarely get to take advantage.",Sam B.,"Brooklyn, NY",10/9/2012,4.0

"Nice and modern inside, very crafty with their design.  I work around here and sometimes just crave vietnamese noodle soup, which are pretty good considering this isn't chinatown.  I finally tried the lemongrass kalbi and i was disappointed, it came in one of those sizzling platter, which I ABSOLUTELY HATE, especially when I have to go back to work and smell like oil for the rest of the day but the worst part is that if you leave the meat on it too long, the meat just gets burned.  It was also very salty and not very lemongrassy.  SKIP.  I'll stick with the noodle soup from now on.  I won't entirely rule it out since it does hit it spot on other items like the summer and spring rolls.  Great service too.  They do give you a free appetizer, but it's random.  Once we got a pork belly which was good but the last time, it was what looked like fried chicken chunks that was cold.  huh?",Y G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",7/3/2012,3.0
"I've been here three times so I feel like I can give a fairly decent review based on service, consistency and having eaten a lot of the menu. I have never had a problem here with the service and the food comes out very fast. I have to also say that although some of the items are very hit or miss, the food is consistently the same (either consistently bad or good).
I will first start off with talking about the fried pork belly. I was the excited to try this the most because they got such rave reviews. When we tried them they were dried out, tough and flavorless. Perhaps we got a bad batch, but I have been scared to try them ever since.
The spare rib on sugar cane was delicious. Both times that I tried it. I tried to get the Chiang Mai noodles the first two times I went. Both times I was told that they are not yet on the menu so how other people had tasted them was beyond me. I finally scored on the 3rd time I was there and they were quite tasty. I thought that they could have had a little more meat in them but over all quite delicious. The Viet Fried Rice and Thai Fried Rice I thought were just MEH and really lacked flavor and were very bland. I had the Pad Se Iew 2x and both times it was really delicious. Oh and I forgot about the salt and pepper shrimp. Really tasty as well but I hate eating shrimp with the skin on..... it just grosses me out.",T- b.,"Denver, CO",4/1/2010,3.0
"I've been to Obao a few times and am a huge fan of their Singapore Laksa - it's consistently good with the perfect balance of flavors and spice.

I have longed for a singaporean Laksa since living in Australia. I was happy to see this on the menu and decided to try the restaurant with my husband. The soup was watery and the noodles did not go with the Laksa. I would give this soup 3 starts.

"I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. Obao was a good rainy day lunch stop for a group of four. Two of us arrived first and were immediately seated in the hidden back room. I was pleasantly surprised by the warm and inviting decor.

One of our appetizers ""Spare Rib On Sugar Cane Skewer"" was excellent! It was done just right, the meat was tender and flavored perfectly. I had visions of a 4 or 5 star dining experience...

3 of us ordered soups to complement the rainy day weather (Pho Bo, Bun Bo Hue, Chiang Mai Curry Noodles) and 1 Pad See Iew. For the most part, the dishes tasted like they do everywhere else. (The exceptions seemed to be the meat: my pig feet in the Bun Bo Hue... I was told the Pat See Iew's kalbi short rib was good as well). The main course food was disappointingly just ""A-OK"" and I'm not sure why it didn't have the same flare the appetizer did. I agree with other reviewers, this would probably be a good lunch alternative for the area though.

So although the food was just 3 stars, the service was excellent and extremely accommodating, especially since one person arrived 30 min late and we hung out forever. Overall, a good spot for a relaxing lunch~",Amy C.,"New York, NY",12/9/2009,3.0

Went to OBao for lunch, had the Pho Bo for 9 dollars. Broth is usually the most important ingredient for pho and OBao got it right! There was a good amount of meat, the only thing I did not like was that the brisket was a little overcooked and tough. The atmosphere was nice (and air conditioned in the back!)

Tonight I passed it and thought maybe I just got it on a bad night last time so I gave it a second chance.  Not worth it.

After reading another foodie's review recommending the pork belly appetizer we decided to give it a try. It was delicious, exactly what you'd want from such a dish. I had the Vietnamese Pork Chop while my friend tried the Kalbi Short Rib with a side of the Sticky Rice. Both meals were very tasty and excellent values.

They're more asian fusion.",m h.,"Brooklyn, NY",6/22/2011,3.0
"Perhaps because I heeded the reviews of those who had gone before, I had a wonderful experience with Obao.

1. The shrimp salad was a wonderful balance of salt, spice, and sugar.  The shrimp were fresh and played off of the fennel, the jalapeno, and the candied tamarind. A refreshing way to start a meal.

2.  The spare ribs on sugar cane were odd, but delicious.  Pork, cut thin, wrapped around sticks of sugar cane.  Glazed with a sweet sauce, and a more-or-less hoisin sauce was provided for dipping.  yum.

3. The pad see iew was actually delicious.  The noodles were well fried, the short rib was tasty and had a subtle sweetness.  Overall, I enjoyed this dish most of all.

4.  The only thing that fell short: the lao yellow rice.  Personally, I found this one bland and unappealing, despite the lure of duck.  It went nearly untouched - especially given the other appealing options on the table.

Overall, I was very surprised how tasty the food was.  Not overly sweet, the fault to which many Thai restaurants succumb.  Unusual for me, but I would definitely order the first three things again - perhaps even in a few days.  It really was that good.",Erica K.,"New York, NY",2/8/2010,4.0
"So we came here for a late lunch on Saturday when our original destinatino was closed for lunch, and were grateful that they honored their lunch special still as we just made it.  Being that we have been disappointed previously by the Viet dishes at Huynh's other establishments, we steered clear from then.  Instead we had the pad kee mao and pad see ew that came with a green salad with ginger dressing for us to start.  The pad see ew was pretty good, the chinese broccoli was still crisp and crunchy while the noodles werent over cooked.  The pad kee mao on the otherhand was a different story.  It was a mushy dish with mushy noodles. The portions were large though and the lunch special was a good deal for the money. We probably wouldn't go back, but it hit the spot for what we were looking for.",CE C.,"New York, NY",11/17/2010,3.0
"Went here for lunch to meet up with a friend who works nearby. I tried the ribs on BBQ sticks with a small bowl of white rice and Thai Ice Tea. The food was delicious and filling and the service is fast. The only thing is we were sitting in the ""outside"" area of the restaurant in the back, so there's no A/C. This is because it can get pretty crowded during the lunch rush, so it's best to come early or later after peak lunch times.",Oliver N.,"New York, NY",6/26/2011,4.0
"i was actually headed to ma peche, but it started to rain and i decided to go to obao to have some pho. i was seated at one of the small tables near the bar. such a cute, cool place (can I use ""cool"" and ""cute"" in the same sentence? but it was!). loved the table tops (couldn't tell if it was bamboo or cork, but it was a natural material) and the grass on the walls. i ordered spring rolls and beef pho. the spring rolls were made with traditional rice paper and was crispy, not oily. the pho base was very rich and dense in flavor. the beef was very good quality and the noodle texture was perfect. i thought the food was pretty reasonable (my pho was $9), but was shocked that my hot tea was $4!
side note: while eating, i saw angelo sosa (from top chef) come in! he is an asian food foodie, so i must've picked the right place! it was just odd, b/c just googled him that morning, wanting to go to his asian restaurant xie xie, but found out it was closed. weird coincidence.",theresa s.,"Honolulu, HI",2/1/2011,3.0

For $10 you get a choice of appetizer, entree, rice and soda.  We enjoyed everything we got: the pork belly was great, as was the spicy chicken.  The pad thai, was topped with a poached egg, like a carbonara sauce, and was a great innovation on a classic.  The dumplings and two spring roll dishes were also worth trying.
